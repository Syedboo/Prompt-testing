This contributed to a 70% growth of its US revenue to $9.5m, as per the company\u2019s 2024 Annual General Meeting (AGM) report.\nEarlier this year, the company has been establishing new partnerships for the deployment of its DDM platform, and in May, partnered with Nvidia and Microsoft to develop a whole genome sequencing analytical solution using the platform.",

        "text": "New data from the TROPION-Lung01 trial show datopotamab deruxtecan treatment led to greater overall survival (OS) than docetaxel chemotherapy in a group of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients.\nThe TROP2-directed antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) is being developed by Daiichi Sankyo and AstraZeneca. Results from the Phase III trial\u2019s (NCT04656652) final OS analysis were presented yesterday (9 September) at the 2024 World Conference on Lung Cancer.\nThe global, multicentre trial enrolled 590 adults with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC who had undergone at least one prior line of therapy. Although OS was not significantly improved with datopotamab deruxtecan compared to chemotherapy in the overall cohort, there was a significant mean improvement of 2.3 months among the nonsquamous disease subgroup of 14.6 months with the ADC versus 12.3 months with chemotherapy.\nThis data builds upon TROPION-Lung01 results presented at the 2023 European Society for Medical Oncology Congress, which showed a clinically significant increase in progression-free survival with datopotamab deruxtecan versus docetaxel for nonsquamous NSCLC patients.\nEntering into collaboration in July 2020, Daiichi Sankyo and AstraZeneca have jointly advanced datopotamab deruxtecan development in more than 20 trials, including seven Phase III trials in lung cancers and five in breast cancers. Datopotamab deruxtecan is not the only instance where both companies have collaborated. The two partners successfully developed and launched the HER2-directed ADC Enhertu (trastuzumab deruxtecan), which is approved for certain types of breast cancer and NSCLC.\nIn March this year, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) granted marketing authorisation to datopotamab for treating nonsquamous NSCLC and HER2-negative breast cancer, based on results from the TROPION-Lung01 and TROPION-Breast01 trials (NCT05104866), respectively. A parallel approval application in NSCLC is currently under review with the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), with a Prescription Drug User Free Act date set on 20 December 2024.\nAccording to a GlobalData report, the NSCLC market, valued at $30.7bn in 2021, is set to grow to $45.4bn by 2031. The space is dominated by Keytruda (pembrolizumab), marketed by MSD, and AstraZeneca\u2019s own Tagrisso (osimertinib mesylate), which are predicted to generate $28.6bn and $6.4bn in 2024 global sales, respectively. GlobalData estimates datopotamab deruxtecan will bring in $6bn in annual global sales by 2030.\nGlobalData is the parent company of Pharmaceutical Technology.\nKen Takeshita, Global Head of Research and Development at Daiichi Sankyo, said the TROPION-Lung01 data would support the company\u2019s comprehensive development program, which will also include an evaluation of TROP2-directed ADC as a combination treatment for earlier lines of therapy in NSCLC.",

        "text": "AstraZeneca has completed all clinical studies required to support the first filings for the transition of its chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) inhaler, Breztri, to a next-generation propellant (NGP) with near-zero global warming potential.\nResults from the clinical studies, which have been presented at conferences this year, will be shared with regulatory authorities. In addition, first submissions in Europe, the UK, and China are expected before the end of this year, the company shared.\nInhalers, specifically those using pressurised metered-dose inhalers (pMDIs), have a significant carbon footprint due to the use of hydrofluoroalkane (HFA) propellants, which are potent greenhouse gases. While inhalers don\u2019t contribute much to global greenhouse gas emissions (less than 0.04%), AstraZeneca has an ambitious target of becoming carbon-negative for all residual emissions by 2030.\nTo address this, new eco-friendly propellants, such as hydrofluoroolefin (HFO) are being developed. Breztri will be the first inhaler in AstraZeneca\u2019s portfolio to use this new, eco-friendly propellant. Named HFO-1234ze, it has 99.9% less impact on global warming compared to the chemicals currently used in inhalers.\nBreztri is a medication used to treat COPD. It is a fixed-dose combination of a corticosteroid (budesonide), a long-acting muscarinic antagonist (glycopyrronium) and a long-acting beta2-adrenergic agonist (formoterol fumarate), which is delivered through a pressurised metered dose inhaler. Marketed as Trixeo Aerosphere in the EU, it is approved to treat COPD in more than 50 countries.\nSee Also:\nNHS develops AI model to predict diabetic retinopathy\nInflammatix secures $57m to advance TriVerity test\nOne Phase I study (NCT06340581), presented at the American Thoracic Society (ATS) 2024 Conference in May, demonstrated that the new eco-friendly HFO propellant performs the same as the current HFA propellant inhaler, both using a spacer, while also evaluating the performance of the new inhaler without a spacer.\nBreztri generated $677m in global sales in 2023, as per AstraZeneca\u2019s financials. According to GlobalData analysis, Breztri sales are expected to rise in the coming years, with the therapy predicted to generate $2.14bn in global sales by 2030.\nSharon Barr, executive vice president of biopharmaceuticals R&D at AstraZeneca, said: \u201cEssential, life-saving medicines delivered to patients by pressurised-metered dose inhalers are the most used treatments in respiratory care and ensuring access to them based on clinical need is critical to optimising patient outcomes.\n\u201cWe have now completed the studies that support the first regulatory filings to transition Breztri to the innovative propellant with near-zero Global Warming Potential as part of our commitment to patients and the planet.\u201d",

        "text": "SGLT2 inhibitors show significant promise in the treatment of heart failure regardless of how long a patient has had type 2 diabetes, as per a new meta-analysis presented at the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) Congress.\nAt the ESC congress, held from 30 August to 2 September, Dr. Jawad Haider Butt, a research fellow at the University of Glasgow\u2019s British Health Foundation Cardiovascular Research Centre, presented data (abstract 13026) surrounding the use of SGLT2 inhibitors in patients with heart failure and type 2 diabetes.\nDespite an industry conception that patients with long-standing type-2 diabetes may be less likely to tolerate and benefit from new treatments, a pooled meta-analysis of AstraZeneca\u2019s DAPA-HF Phase III trial (NCT03036124) and the Phase III DELIVER trial (NCT03619213), investigating Forxiga (dapagliflozin propanediol), showed that the benefit of Forxiga or Farxiga on the primary outcome was consistent across patients with different type 2 diabetes durations. Furthermore, treatment with Forxiga had a consistent benefit on the worsening of heart failure across type 2 diabetes patients.\nThe pairing of type 2 diabetes and heart failure can be fairly common in patients, explained Butt. Several companies pursue drug development in the two indications due to their overlapping pathogenesis. For example, in 2014, the US Food and Drug Administration first approved Forxiga for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. AstraZeneca has since received approvals for the drug in other metabolic indications, like heart failure with reduced ejection fraction in 2020.\nOther SGLT2 inhibitor drugs such as Johnson and Johnson\u2019s Invokana (canagliflozin) and Boehringer Ingelheim and Eli Lilly\u2019s Jardiance (empagliflozin) are also marketed for the treatment of heart failure and type 2 diabetes in the US. The class of drugs has made a major impact on the heart failure treatment landscape in recent years, amassing significant sales for each company.\nSee Also:\nMK-8189 by Merck for Schizophrenia: Likelihood of Approval\nAvelumab by Merck for Angiosarcoma: Likelihood of Approval\nIn a Q2 financial report, Eli Lilly shared that its US revenue from Jardiance reached $428.9m during the quarter. Furthermore, a 2023 annual financial report labelled Forxiga as AstraZeneca\u2019s best-selling drug that year, making $5.96bn in global sales.",

Of this amount, \u00a3450m would be allocated to the facility in Speke while the other \u00a3200m would be used to develop facilities in Cambridge.\nUndisclosed sources briefed on discussions between the government and AstraZeneca said the Labour government may reduce the previous government\u2019s pledge of \u00a390m to \u00a340m.\nAttracting manufacturing investment has been a key part of the life sciences strategy for the UK. The government has also pursued similar projects with other companies, similar to one with Moderna to establish an mRNA facility. In his Spring 2024 budget speech, Jeremy Hunt, the Shadow Chancellor of the Exchequer said: \u201cAstraZeneca\u2019s investment plans are a vote of confidence in the attractiveness of the UK as a life sciences superpower and strengthen our resilience for future health emergencies.\u201d\nSee Also:\nJapan approves updated Covid-19 vaccine to tackle JN.1 variant\nFDA approves Roche\u2019s Tecentriq Hybreza for cancer\n\u201cWe are in positive discussions with AstraZeneca to support the delivery of this planned investment in Speke,\u201d a UK Treasury spokesperson told Reuters following the Financial Times report. \u201cWe have no idea where the comments in some media come from and they do not seem to be based on facts. As an example, there are no discussions in the US or India,\u201d an AstraZeneca spokesperson told Reuters.\nAndrew Griffith, the UK\u2019s shadow technology secretary, told the Financial Times that if the UK government failed to meet its funding pledge it would be a \u201chuge backwards step for the UK\u201d. Griffith was involved in the coordination of the government\u2019s initial agreement with AstraZeneca.\nIt would be \u201ctragic\u201d if the government failed to meet the previous pledge, added Sir Mene Pangalos, the former executive prime minister at AstraZeneca in a 14 August LinkedIn post.\n\u201cThe government needs to be pulling and encouraging R&D and capital investment in the UK not making it difficult.\u201d\nIn her term as finance minister, Reeves has so far promised to deliver economic stability to the UK while disparaging the economic state left behind by the previous Conservative Government.\n\u201cAfter 14 years, Britain has a stable government. A government that respects business, wants to partner with business, and is open for business,\u201d said Reeves in an 8 July statement.",

        "text": "Comparing Covid-19 Vaccine Prices Globally\nPharma giant Johnson & Johnson (J&J) has offered its widely authorised, one-shot Covid-19 vaccine to countries on a not-for-profit basis since the jab was first approved \u2013 but it appears this could soon change. The company\u2019s executive vice president Ashley McEvoy suggested in a recent third-quarter results call that it was looking at moving into a commercial market either late next year or in 2023.\nFree Whitepaper\nWhat is the impact of China\u2019s Zero-COVID lockdowns on economic activity, consumer goods and the foodservice industry?\nWhile wanting to protect the country from being overwhelmed by Omicron, China\u2019s adherence to a Zero-COVID policy is resulting in a significant economic downturn. COVID outbreaks in Shanghai, Beijing and many other Chinese cities will impact 2022\u2019s economic growth...\nRead more\nBy GlobalData\nThe switch to a commercial pricing model will come after full regulatory approval of the vaccine \u2013 J&J\u2019s shot is currently only available under emergency use authorisation \u2013 but McEvoy indicated that the company is gearing up to file for approval soon.\nMajor Covid-19 vaccine maker AstraZeneca has also pledged to provide jabs on a not-for-profit basis until the end of the pandemic \u2013 though it has reserved the right to decide when that is \u2013 while other frontrunners like Pfizer and Moderna have already made a fortune from their coronavirus vaccines.\nVaccine pricing policies\nLast summer, Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla told TIME that he expected the company to make a \u201cvery marginal profit\u201d at that stage in the pandemic. Just a year later, Pfizer forecasted it would reap $33.5bn in Covid-19 vaccine revenue, following a series of lucrative supply deals with the world\u2019s wealthiest countries.\nSimilarly, Moderna CEO Stephane Bancel said back at the start of the pandemic that \u201cthere is no world, I think, where we would contemplate to price [the Covid-19 vaccine] higher than other respiratory virus vaccines\u201d. While it\u2019s true that jabs for respiratory diseases can carry price tags ranging from tens to hundreds of dollars per dose, Moderna\u2019s Covid-19 vaccine is among the priciest on the market, with per-dose costs ranging between $32 and $37 for smaller supply deals.\nBoth Pfizer and Moderna upped European prices for their products this year; the EU will now pay $23.15 per dose of Pfizer\u2019s jab (up from \u20ac$18.40), while Moderna is charging $25.50 for doses that previously cost around $22.60. The latter\u2019s American-made vaccine is considerably cheaper in the US, where each dose costs about $15, while Pfizer is charging the US government around $24, up from the $19.50 paid in earlier deals.\nBourla told CNBC: \u201cThe price from the high-income countries is the cost of a takeaway meal \u2026 But for the middle-income countries, we are charging half of this price, and the low-income countries we are charging basically at non-for-profit.\u201d\nJ&J, which is currently offering its jab on a not-for-profit basis, has priced the vaccine at $10 per dose \u2013 though the EU is reportedly paying slightly less than other countries, at $8.50. AstraZeneca\u2019s Vaxzevria is the cheapest of the leading vaccines, costing as little as $3.16 per dose for Brazil and ranging between $3.50 and $6 elsewhere.\nWhich countries are paying more for vaccines?\nAs the debate about vaccine inequity in low-income countries rages on, even nations with access to the leading Covid-19 jabs are paying wildly different prices for doses.\nAfrican nations have struggled to secure sufficient vaccine supplies throughout the pandemic, and some are being charged considerably more for doses than their wealthy counterparts. South Africa \u2013 the worst hit of all African countries \u2013 is reportedly paying $5.25 per dose of the AstraZeneca jab, while European countries are being charged just $3.50. The price tag is even steeper for Uganda, which is reportedly paying $7 for each dose of AstraZeneca\u2019s two-shot vaccine.\nEarlier this year, Moderna offered its vaccine to South Africa at $30 to $42 per dose \u2013 significantly more costly than the $32 to $37 range paid by higher-income countries for the same jab. Botswana\u2019s government also confirmed this summer that the country is paying almost $29 per dose, a far higher price point than those agreed for the US and EU.\nColombia, another country hit particularly hard by the virus, is paying around $30 per dose of Moderna\u2019s vaccine \u2013 double the amount the US has been charged. Analysis by the People\u2019s Vaccine Alliance, based on the estimated production costs of Moderna and Pfizer\u2019s Covid-19 vaccines, found that Colombia has potentially overpaid by as much as $375m for both companies\u2019 shots combined.\nBangladesh is reportedly paying $4 for each dose of AstraZeneca\u2019s vaccine manufactured by the Serum Institute of India, compared to the $3.50 paid by EU member states buying directly from the British vaccine maker.\nThough some of the prices negotiated between vaccine makers and governments are publicly available, a general lack of transparency regarding vaccine supply deals makes it difficult to scrutinise and understand the discrepancies in fees paid by rich and less wealthy nations.\nCommenting on the findings by the People\u2019s Vaccine Alliance, UNAIDS executive director Winnie Byanyima said: \u201cHealth workers are dying on the frontline all over the world every single day. Uganda alone lost more than 50 health workers in just two weeks.\n\u201cA reminder of the time when millions of people were dying of HIV in developing countries because the medicines that could save them were priced too high.\u201d\nAdditional research and data visualisation by Andrew Hillman",

It targets HER2, a protein associated with aggressive breast cancer.\nThe FDA granted the designation based on preliminary results from the global, randomised, open-label Phase III DESTINY-Breast06 trial.\nSee Also:\nJapan approves updated Covid-19 vaccine to tackle JN.1 variant\nFDA approves Roche\u2019s Tecentriq Hybreza for cancer\nIt compared the efficacy and safety of ENHERTU against standard chemotherapies.\nThis trial involved 866 patients across Asia, Europe, North America, Oceania and South America.\nWith this latest BTD, ENHERTU has now received eight such designations, four of which are for metastatic breast cancer.\nPrevious BTDs were granted for later-line HER2 low, second-line HER2 positive and later-line HER2 positive metastatic breast cancers.\nDaiichi Sankyo research and development global head Ken Takeshita stated: \u201cIf approved, ENHERTU could once again change the treatment paradigm for certain patients with breast cancer, pushing past old boundaries and broadening the number of people who may be eligible for a HER2-directed therapy.\n\u201cThe designation also showcases Daiichi Sankyo\u2019s commitment to pioneering cutting-edge science to deliver medicines like ENHERTU that create new standards of care for patients with cancer.\u201d",

        "author": "Jenna Philpott",
        "date": "Fri, 16 Aug 2024 15:02:18 GMT",
        "text": "AstraZeneca\u2019s Imfinzi (durvalumab) plus chemotherapy has secured US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in the perioperative setting, just weeks after the agency called for an overhaul of perioperative lung cancer trials.\nThis approval is for patients with resectable early-stage (IIA-IIIB) NSCLC and no known epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations or anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) rearrangements. In this regimen, patients are treated in the perioperative setting \u2013 a term that refers to the time before, during, and after surgery.\nIn a 25 July meeting, the FDA\u2019s Oncologic Drugs Advisory Committee (ODAC) raised concerns about the design of trials done in this setting. The Imfinzi approval is based on positive data from the Phase III AEGEAN study (NCT03800134), which showed that the perioperative use of the treatment reduced the risk of cancer returning, progressing, or causing death by 32% compared to using chemotherapy alone.\nHowever, the study did not distinguish between the pre- and post-surgery phases, making it unclear which part of the treatment was most effective\u2014one of the main concerns raised by the ODAC. Despite FDA advice to design the study to assess these phases individually, AstraZeneca did not follow this guidance, as per a briefing document released prior to the meeting.\nWithout information on the impact of treatment on each phase, the committee members opined that it is difficult to gauge side effects from the treatment without understanding the additional benefits. This could have \u201cthe potential for overtreatment for perioperative immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) regimens,\u201d the committee said in the 25 July briefing document.\nSee Also:\nMK-8189 by Merck for Schizophrenia: Likelihood of Approval\nAvelumab by Merck for Angiosarcoma: Likelihood of Approval\nDespite the deliberation on the ideal study design, the Imfinzi approval doesn\u2019t come as a surprise, as the overall majority of the ODAC suggested that it should be approved in this indication. However, the committee meeting ended with an 11\u20130 vote in favour of changing how perioperative trials are run in the future.\nImfinzi was first approved for treating bladder cancer in 2017. Its label was later expanded to include more indications including unresectable NSCLC, small-cell lung cancer, metastatic NSCLC, and endometrial cancer. In 2023, Imfinzi earned sales of $4.2bn, as per AstraZeneca\u2019s financials. According to GlobalData\u2019s Pharma Intelligence Center, Imfinzi will pull in sales worth $6.6bn in 2030.\nImfinzi joins MSD\u2019s Keytruda (pembrolizumab), which gained FDA approval in the perioperative setting for NSCLC in October 2023 based on the Phase III KEYNOTE-671 study (NCT03425643). Keytruda, which is approved for several cancer indications, is set to generate $21.3bn in sales in 2030, according to GlobalData.\nGlobalData is the parent company of Pharmaceutical Technology.\nIn the announcement accompanying the approval, executive vice president of the oncology business unit at AstraZeneca Dave Fredrickson said: \u201cToday\u2019s approval of Imfinzi in resectable early-stage lung cancer builds on its strong foundation of changing clinical practice in unresectable Stage III disease.\u201d",

Elliott had suggested Starbucks expand its board and make its executive Jesse Cohn a director, though it was not demanding a CEO change.\nElliott on Tuesday said that Niccol\u2019s appointment was \u201ca transformational step forward\u201d for the company. \u201cWe look forward to continuing our engagement with the Board as it works toward the realization of Starbucks\u2019 full potential,\u201d it said.\nCraig Garthwaite, a professor at Northwestern\u2019s Kellogg School of Management, said Niccol \u201chas taken an upscale fast food restaurant chain and improved it before, and that is what Starbucks is today, a fast-food restaurant. For Niccol this could be the ultimate challenge in fixing the perception that\u2019s weighing on the company and the business problems.\u201d\n5:18PM\nEurope\u2019s Stoxx 600 hits two-week closing high\nEurope\u2019s benchmark stock index closed at a near two-week high on Tuesday, as growing hopes of an interest rate cut from the US Federal Reserve in September offset a drag from weak earnings from the likes of Swiss medtech firm Tecan.\nThe continent-wide Stoxx 600 index, which includes some of Britain\u2019s biggest companies, closed 0.5pc higher. While healthcare and utilities were the top sectoral gainers, basic resources was the worst hit.\n5:15PM\nGlobal stock markets climb as data shows US inflation slows\nGlobal stocks mostly rose on Tuesday as slowing US inflation boosted hopes of interest rate cuts.\nThe week\u2019s main focus for the markets is expected to be US consumer inflation figures out on Wednesday, which could influence the Federal Reserve\u2019s monetary policy decision-making.\nHowever, investors got reassuring wholesale price data on Tuesday, sending Wall Street stocks higher.\nThe producer price index (PPI) rose by 0.1 percent in July, down slightly from a 0.2 rise in June, the US Labor Department said.\nFrance\u2019s Cac 40 rose 0.4pc, while Germany\u2019s Dax rose 0.5pc.

It has lost 6.2pc since the start of the attack on August 6.\nTrading between the rouble and major currencies shifted to the so-called over-the-counter market, meaning trade that is not made on a formal exchange, after new Western sanctions were introduced on June 12.\n4:19PM\nSwitch to electric cars may take \u2018longer than anyone expects\u2019\nThe switch to electric cars risks taking far longer than hoped as demand stalls in Europe and America, the boss of one of the world\u2019s biggest parts suppliers has warned. Matt Oliver reports:\nLiam Butterworth, chief executive of GKN Automotive parent Dowlais, said the scrapping of electric vehicle (EV) tax breaks in countries such as Germany had triggered a sales slowdown that was reverberating through the industry.\nThis is translating into smaller orders for component suppliers, as big car manufacturers including Ford, Volkswagen and Mercedes-Benz push back production schedules.\nMr Butterworth said: \u201cConsumer sentiment associated with EVs \u2013 when you look at insurance, residual values and charging infrastructure \u2013 has clearly got to a point where the pace of the transition has slowed down significantly.\n\u201cMy view is that transition is going to take much, much longer than anybody expected.\u201d\nConcerns continued to grow on Tuesday, as it emerged Volkswagen may delay the launch of a new version of its ID.4 electric car from 2026 until the early 2030s.\nRead the full story...\n4:06PM\nBoeing orders rebound in July thanks to Farnborough Airshow\nUS aeroplane manufacturer Boeing\u2019s orders rebounded in July after a first half of the year overshadowed by quality control problems, and remained on track with deliveries, according to data unveiled Tuesday.\nIn the wake of the Farnborough International Airshow in the United Kingdom in July, Boeing said it had booked 72 orders, including 57 for its flagship 737 Max aircraft.\nOrders for the Max came mainly from two leasing companies: Aviation Capital Group, which ordered 35, and Macquarie AirFinance which ordered 20.\nThe strong figures for July mark a significant change from May and June, when Boeing\u2019s net orders were just three and 12, respectively.\nIn the first seven months of the year, Boeing won 228 gross orders, but a net figure of only 98, after cancellations and conversions were taken into account. Over the same period last year, it won 579 orders, according to its website.\nBoeing\u2019s order book contained 6,184 aircraft as of July 31, including almost 4,200 737 Maxes.\n4:01PM\n\u2018Back to normal\u2019 for tech stocks\nNasdaq, the US index that heavily represents tech stocks, is up 1.6pc this afternoon. Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at online trading platform IG, said:\nIt feels like \u2018back to normal\u2019 for markets as tech stocks lead the way higher again following the lower US PPI [inflation] data [covered on this blog earlier].\nThe reading has given heart to beleaguered investors, who remain skittish after last week\u2019s volatility.\nSetting aside the carnage in the yen and the Nikkei, last week feels very much like a normal pullback in an otherwise strong year, and recession fears, like expectations of a more dramatic cut in rates, have been dialled back over the past few sessions.\n3:58PM\nPound rises against softening dollar\nThe pound has risen against other major currencies today, rising 0.4pc against the dollar and the yen, and by 0.2pc against the euro.\nSterling has been boosted after Britain\u2019s unemployment rate unexpectedly fell in June.\nMeanwhile, the dollar has weakened against the rest of its peers, with markets waiting for fresh US inflation data that could indicate the outlook for Federal Reserve interest rate cuts.\nThe dollar began softening after the release of data showing US producer prices increased less than expected in July as a rise in the cost of goods was tempered by cheaper services, indicating that inflation continued to moderate.\nErik Nelson, macro strategist, at Wells Fargo Securities in London, said:\nWe\u2019re seeing little bit of weakness, and part of the issue is we don\u2019t have a CPI [inflation report] yet. We did see a little bit of dollar weakness. The core PPI [inflation] number was actually kind of strong, which may be holding back the dollar weakness as well.\n3:48PM\nHelloFresh shares soar 14pc after promise that costs will be cut\nThanks for joining me, Alex Singleton, this afternoon on the Markets blog.\nInvestors smiled on HelloFresh shares today, as the meal kit business attempts to boost profits with a cost-cutting plan.\nUnderlying profits for second quarter of 2024 was \u20ac146m (\u00a3125m), compared with \u20ac192m a year earlier.\nBut sales at the meal kit business continued to grow, rising by 4.7pc, which the company said was driven by its ready-to-eat range.\nBloomberg reported that Bernstein analysts have told their clients that the lack of major surprises, after the company had previous lowered investors\u2019 expectations in March and November, is \u201ccrucial\u201d for rebuilding investors\u2019 confidence.\nShares rose 14pc, but are still down 75pc over the past year.\n3:33PM\nLab-grown diamonds to overtake traditional stones by 2035, says Pandora\nLab-grown diamonds will be more popular than traditional stones within the next 10 years, the boss of jewellery giant Pandora has said, as younger customers look for cheaper alternatives.\nOur retail editor Hannah Boland has the details:\nAlexander Lacik said the \u201cvastly lower cost\u201d and smaller environmental impact of the jewels would spark a \u201cmassive\u201d shift in customers towards lab-grown diamonds.\nPandora stopped selling mined diamonds in 2021, saying this would allow it to make its pieces more accessible to more shoppers. Lab-grown diamonds sell for around a third of the price of mined jewels.\nSpeaking to Bloomberg, Mr Lacik said: \u201cA diamond is a diamond regardless of whether it comes from the mine or it comes from the lab. So ten years on my prediction is that the vast majority of diamonds being sold are going to be lab grown. I think we\u2019re in front of a big transformation here.\u201d\nThe comments came as Pandora raised its forecasts for sales this year, despite saying consumer spending had been \u201csomewhat sluggish\u201d. Other luxury firms have been struggling with a slowdown, including leader LVMH which warned over customers reigning in spending on champagne last month. Richemont, the owner of Cariter, also said it had been hit by weaker demand, particularly in China.\nThe upgrade from Pandora came just months after another lift to its forecasts when it cited the strong demand for lab-grown diamonds.\nPandora had previously been viewed as a retailer which focused on charms for bracelets and necklaces, but has been looking to transform itself into a full-range jewellery chain.\n3:13PM\nAsda hit by fresh sales slowdown after chairman attacks \u2018embarrassing\u2019 performance\nAsda has been hit by a fresh slump in sales just days after its chairman admitted he was \u201cembarrassed\u201d by the supermarket\u2019s recent performance.\nOur retail editor Hannah Boland has the latest:\nAsda sales tumbled 6pc in the 12 weeks to August 4, according to new year-on-year figures from Kantar, making it the only major supermarket where trading is in decline.\nThe latest drop in sales led to its market share sliding to 12.6pc, down from 14.8pc when the business was bought by the Issa brothers in February 2021.\nBy contrast, in the latest 12-week period rival Sainsbury\u2019s recorded its largest year-on-year market share increase since July 1997.\nRead how the industry data will fuel concerns over Asda\u2019s competitiveness in the retail market.\n2:53PM\nUK stocks rise amid declining US wholesale inflation\nThe FTSE 100 is back in positive territory after a lunchtime lull as figures showed US wholesale inflation fell by more than expected last month.\nThe blue-chip stock index was up 0.2pc and the midcap FTSE 250 was up 0.3pc as the data cemented bets that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates at its September meeting.\nMoney markets predict there is a 62pc chance that the Fed will cut rates by half a percentage

500 rose 32.6 points, or 0.6pc to 5376.98\u200b, while the Nasdaq Composite rose 164.1 points, or 1pc, to 16944.735.\n2:20PM\nTraders reduce bets on interest rate cuts after unemployment surprise\nTraders are reducing bets on the Bank of England cutting interest rates next month after a surprise fall in unemployment.\nMoney markets are pricing in a 37pc chance that policymakers will follow up their first rate cut in four years earlier this month with an immediate second reduction in borrowing costs in September.\nThe pound rose 0.3pc and tipped over $1.28 for the first time since the global stock market sell-off last week after the latest official figures showed unemployment unexpectedly fell in the three months to June.\nThe Office for National Statistics said the unemployment rate dropped to 4.2pc, down from 4.4pc in the three months to May and well below analyst estimates that it would rise to 4.5pc.\nHowever, wage growth slowed to its lowest level for more than two years, complicating the picture for the Bank of England.\nRuth Gregory, deputy chief UK economist at Capital Economics, said: \u201cWe still think the Bank will pause in September before pressing ahead with two more 25 basis point rate cuts in November and December.\u201d\n2:11PM\nGold prices rise as US wholesale inflation drops\nThe price of gold has risen as falling US wholesale inflation cemented bets that the Federal Reserve will begin cutting interest rates next month.\nBullion was up 0.2pc to $2,468.50 after gaining 1.7pc on Monday after the producer price index (PPI) rose less than expected last month.\nGold has gained almost 20% so far this year, benefiting from mounting optimism on rate cuts and large purchases by central banks.\nIt has also benefited from conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle due to its status as a safe haven asset.\n1:53PM\nCrest Nicholson \u2018confident\u2019 despite Bellway abandoning \u00a3720m takeover\nCrest Nicholson said it \u201cremains confident in its standalone prospects\u201d after Bellway abandoned its \u00a3720m takeover of the house builder.\nIt previously said it was \u201cminded\u201d to accept the deal, but Bellway has now said it will not put forward a firm offer after talks between the companies.\nCrest shares have fallen 15.7pc despite the company saying it was confident thanks to a \u201creview of provisions for completed development sites supported by external consultants, its highly attractive land portfolio and the new leadership of Martyn Clark\u201d.\nThe house builder has also received interest over a potential merger deal from rival developer Avant Homes, which is owned by New York hedge fund Elliott.\nAvant, which is led by former Persimmon boss Jeff Fairburn, saw its bid to buy Crest rejected last month.\nThe bid interest is the latest in a line of major mergers in the housebuilding industry, with companies joining forces after a period of high mortgage rates and weaker demand.\nEarlier this year, two of Britain\u2019s biggest housebuilders, Barratt Developments and Redrow, agreed to a tie-up worth \u00a32.5bn which they said would accelerate housebuilding across the country.\n1:37PM\nWall Street expected to open higher after wholesale inflation falls\nUS stock indexes are on track to make gains when markets open later after a producer prices report showed inflation pressures easing, keeping the Federal Reserve on track to cut interest rates in September.\nData from the US Labor Department showed the producer price index rose to 2.2pc in July, higher

boss Laxman Narasimhan has stepped down just five months after taking the helm at the struggling coffee giant.\nChipotle chairman and chief executive Brian Niccol has been appointed to the same positions and will move over on September 9, having turned around the fortunes of the Mexican grill chain.\nStarbucks shares have fallen by 28pc since November last year, including a 16pc drop in May amid declining sales as customers shun more expensive coffee.\nMr Narasimhan, who joined after serving as chief executive of Reckitt, which owns brands like Lysol, Durex and Mucinex. He also previously worked at PepsiCo and McKinsey.\nStarbucks shares jumped 12pc after the appointment of Mr Niccol, who has also served as chief executive of Taco Bell.\nMellody Hobson, Starbucks board chair, who will become lead independent director in the boardroom shakeup, said:\nWe are thrilled to welcome Brian to Starbucks. His phenomenal career speaks for itself.

But security firms monitoring global hacking threats did not record unusual levels of traffic to X, formerly known as Twitter.\nRead how it comes days after Mr Musk shared a fake Telegraph article to his millions of followers, which he later deleted.\n11:39AM\nPrivate sector pay heading in right direction for Bank of England, say economists\nPrivate sector pay growth slowed down even more markedly than overall regular pay, dropping from 5.6pc to 5.2pc in the three months to June.\nBank of England Governor Andrew Bailey said at a press conference earlier this month that private sector pay was a bigger concern with regard to wage growth than pay in the public sector.\nJulian Jessop, an economist at the IEA think tank, said it is going in the right direction for policymakers:\nMost important figure for the #BankofEngland today is regular private sector #pay growth, which slowed from 5.6% to 5.2% in the 3m to June and to just 4.9% in June alone \ud83d\udc47\nStill high but, if you're worried about a 'wage-price spiral', heading in the right direction.#inflation pic.twitter.com/os5xcybM8F\n\u2014 Julian Jessop FRSA (@julianHjessop) August 13, 2024\n11:20AM\nOil prices fall amid potential surplus\nOil prices have edged lower after the International Energy Agency warned of a potential surplus later this year.\nBrent crude, the international benchmark, was down 0.3pc to about $82 a barrel after rising by almost 8pc over the previous five sessions.\nUS-produced West Texas Intermediate was down 0.2pc to below $80 a barrel after the Opec cartel on Monday trimmed its forecast for global oil demand, blaming a weak economy in China.\nToday, the IEA warned that the global oil market could face a surplus in the final quarter of the year if Opec pushed ahead with plans to ramp up production in October.\nYeap Jun Rong, a market strategist at IG Asia, said:\nEyes will be on the upcoming US inflation to anchor the Fed\u2019s upcoming policy easing path.\nRisks of a hard landing are not totally out of the window yet.\n10:56AM\nGas prices decline as Russian supplies hold up\nGas prices have edged lower for a second day amid signs that Russian gas will keep flowing through Ukraine despite conflict around a key transit point.\nDutch front-month futures, Europe\u2019s benchmark contract, fell as much as 2.4pc to trade at about \u20ac39 per megawatt hour.\nPrices rose as high as \u20ac42 from \u20ac34 at the start of last week after Ukrainian soldiers crossed the Russian border about 330 miles southwest of Moscow a week ago.\nUkraine launched fresh drone attacks on Russia\u2019s border region of Kursk today.\nFlorence Schmit, a European energy strategist at Rabobank, said:\nNow that Russia and Ukraine have said they want to continue the gas flows some of the risk premium is easing.\nBut the risk premium from the Middle East is still a reality, and this is why prices will most likely remain in the mid 30s range in the absence of a further escalation.\n10:29AM\nGerman confidence plunges at sharpest pace in two years\nInvestor confidence in Germany has suffered a steep decline amid the turmoil in global markets and an uncertain economic outlook, a closely watched survey shows.\nThe ZEW Indicator of Economic Sentiment showed that confidence more than halved in one month, plummeting by 22.6 points to 19.2 points.\nIt was the sharpest drop since July 2022 and took sentiment to its lowest level since January.\nZEW president Professor Achim Wambach said:\nThe economic outlook for Germany is breaking down. In the current survey, we observe the strongest decline of the economic expectations over the past two years.\nEconomic expectations for the eurozone, the US and China also deteriorate markedly. As a result, especially the expectations for export-intensive German sectors decline.\nIt is likely that economic expectations are still affected by high uncertainty, which is driven by ambiguous monetary policy, disappointing business data from the US economy and growing concerns over an escalation of the conflict in the Middle East.\nMost recently, this uncertainty expressed itself in a turmoil on international stock markets.\nGermany Zew Economic Sentiment Indexhttps://t.co/2TOP8G26fS pic.twitter.com/1MlsnYML0b\n\u2014 TRADING ECONOMICS (@tEconomics) August 13, 2024\n10:13AM\nOil market faces glut of supply, industry warns\nThe oil market could be hit with a surplus of stocks later this year if the Opec cartel proceeds with plans to ramp up production from October, an industry body has warned.\nOil stockpiles will stabilise in the final quarter of the year, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA), but would tip into surplus if the Saudi-led group increases output.\nThe Opec+ cartel - which includes allies like Russia - has outlined plans that would increase production by about 543,000 barrels a day during the final quarter of the year, but it has stressed the plans could be \u201cpaused or reversed\u201d depending on market conditions.\nThe Paris-based IEA said:\nDespite the marked slowdown in Chinese oil demand growth, Opec+ has yet to call time on its plan to gradually unwind voluntary production cuts starting in the fourth quarter.\nFor now, supply is struggling to keep pace with peak summer demand, tipping the market into a deficit.\n9:51AM\nFood inflation rises for first time in more than a year\nGrocery price inflation has risen for the first time since March last year, figures show, clouding the picture for the Bank of England as policymakers decide whether to cut interest rates again next month.\nSupermarket prices were 1.8pc higher than a year ago over the month to August 4, nudging up slightly from 1.6pc in July, analysts Kantar said.\nThe increase follows 17 straight months of falling rates from a peak of 17.5pc to its lowest point since September 2021 in July.\nConsumers are witnessing a mixed picture on supermarket shelves, with prices rising across 182 product categories while the cost of 89 others fell. Kitchen towels and baked beans are 7pc and 5pc cheaper respectively than last year.\nFraser McKevitt, head of retail and consumer insight at Kantar, said:\nHaving reached its lowest rate in almost three years in July, August saw inflation nudge up again slightly.\nWhile this is noticeable following 17 straight months of falling rates, it actually marks a return to the average levels seen in the five years before the start of the cost-of-living crisis.\nWith this kind of pricing spread, shoppers will find that the type of product they\u2019re putting in their baskets will really dictate how much they pay.\n9:44AM\nRussian rouble plunges further after Ukraine launches assault\nThe Russian rouble weakened for the sixth consecutive trading session following Ukraine\u2019s unexpected attack a week ago on Russia\u2019s Kursk region.\nThe rouble was 1.6pc weaker on the day at 92.50 to the dollar, according to LSEG data. It has lost 8.5pc since the start of the attack on August 6.\nThe weakening of the rouble against the dollar and euro has continued despite support from higher oil prices and increased net daily sales of yuan by the central bank and finance ministry.\nUkraine has pummelled two Russian regions with drones today as its ground forces try to smash through defensive lines in a bid to carve out even more territory in its biggest attack on Russian territory since the war began two years ago.\nUkrainian soldiers crossed the Russian border, about 330 miles southwest of Moscow, a week ago.\nPresident Vladimir Putin said the surprise attack was aimed at improving Kyiv\u2019s negotiating position ahead of possible ceasefire talks.\nMuch of the fighting has centred around the town of Sudzha, through which Russia pumps gas from Western Siberia through Ukraine and on to Slovakia and other European Union countries.\n9:29AM\nPound rises after unemployment surprise\nThe pound rose after data showed Britain\u2019s unemployment rate unexpectedly fell in June, although wage growth slowed.\nFigures showed the UK jobless rate dropped to 4.2pc in June, according to the ONS, down from 4.4pc in May and below expectations of a rise to 4.5pc.\nSterling was last up 0.3pc and tipped over $1.28 for the first time since the global sell-off in financial markets last week.\nThe euro was down 0.3pc against the pound at 85.3p.\nThe ONS figures also showed average weekly earnings excluding bonuses were 5.4pc higher than a year earlier in the three months through June, down from 5.8pc in May.\n9:08AM\n\u00a33.4bn electricity \u2018superhighway\u2019 between Scotland and England approved\nEnergy regulator Ofgem has approved a \u00a33.4bn electricity \u201csuperhighway\u201d between Scotland and England in the biggest single investment for electricity transmission infrastructure in Britain.\nThe 311-mile Eastern Green Link 2 (EGL2) project will stretch from Aberdeenshire to North Yorkshire and will transport vast amounts of renewable energy between Scotland and England.\nThe joint venture between Scottish and Southern Electricity Networks and National Grid is part of a push to modernise the electricity grid to deal with greater demands placed on it by the green transition.\nThe new network capacity from the power line will carry enough renewable electricity to power two million homes, Ofgem said, describing it as a \u201csuperhighway\u201d.\nThe massive new interconnector cable will be able to move two gigawatts of electricity between Scotland and England, partly enabling the latter to benefit from offshore wind energy generated by offshore wind farms in the North Sea.\nChief executive Jonathan Brearley said:\nOfgem is fully committed to supporting the Government to meet its aims of getting clean power by 2030.\nToday\u2019s announcement is a further step in putting the regulatory systems and processes in place to speed up network regulation to achieve its aim.\n8:57AM\nFTSE 100 rises ahead of inflation figures\nThe FTSE 100 inched higher amid broader gains in the run-up to crucial inflation numbers in the United States and the UK.\nThe blue-chip FTSE 100 index was up 0.1pc, while the mid-cap FTSE 250 index added 0.3pc.\nThe indexes were set to extend their rally for a third consecutive session after closing lower for a second straight week on Friday.\nMost sectors trended upward but car makers lead declines amid a fall of as much as 17.4pc in Dowlais Group.\nThe company sank to the bottom of the FTSE 250 after it said it was exploring a potential sale of its GKN Powder Metallurgy unit, among other options, and cut its annual revenue forecast.\nIndustrial metal miners dipped as much as 0.7pc amid easing copper prices.\nAmong other stocks, Just Group surged 13.5pc to top the FTSE 250 after it said it expected to exceed its previous 2024 profit forecast after its first-half earnings surpassed market expectations.\nInvestors are awaiting inflation figures for the UK and US, both of which are out tomorrow, to indicate how quickly the Bank of England and Federal Reserve will cut interest rates.\n8:39AM\nWage growth likely to raise state pension by \u00a3517\nWage growth will likely be used to calculate the rise in the state pension, analysts have said, likely giving pensioners a \u00a3517 boost next year.\nTotal pay, which includes bonuses, rose by 4.5pc in the three months to June, which was down from 5.7pc in the previous period after it was affected by the payment of one-off bonuses in NHS last year.\nThe figure is still far higher than inflation or 2.5pc, making it likely that wages will be the figure taken for state pension uprating next month under the triple lock.\nIf the figure were to remain the same next month, then we could see the full new state pension get a boost of around \u00a3517 \u2013 taking it to approx. \u00a312,019 per year.\nHelen Morrissey, head of retirement analysis at Hargreaves Lansdown, said:\nWage growth remains robust, so it\u2019s highly likely that next month\u2019s figure will be the one used to uprate state pension under the triple lock.\nSuch a rise will be welcomed by pensioners still emerging from the cost-of-living crisis. However, with many still reeling from the news that their Winter Fuel payment is to be taken away, it won\u2019t be quite the boost that many hoped for.\nThere\u2019s another looming challenge - frozen tax thresholds mean that the full new state pension is creeping ever closer to tax paying territory and a similar rise next year could see it surpass it. With these freezes in place until 2028, there\u2019s every chance, we could see pensioners solely reliant on the state pension finding part of it is making its way to the taxman.\n8:31AM\nSlowdown in wage growth \u2018clears path for more rate cuts this year\u2019\nUK earnings growth slowed to its lowest for more than two years, which economists have said has \u201ccleared the path for more interest rate cuts\u201d by the Bank of England later this year.\nThe Office for National Statistics (ONS) revealed that regular wage growth was 5.4pc year on year over the three months to June, down from 5.7pc in the previous three months and represented the smallest increase since the period to August 2022.\nRuth Gregory, deputy chief UK economist at Capital Economics, said:\nThe further easing in wage growth will be welcomed by the Bank of England as a sign that labour market conditions are continuing to cool.\nThis lends some support to our forecast that the Bank of England will press ahead with two more 25bps interest rate cuts later this year.\nWe still think the Bank will pause in September before pressing ahead with two more 25bps rate cuts in November and December.\nBut much will depend on a broader range of indicators of price pressures, including services CPI inflation. July\u2019s inflation figures will be released tomorrow.\n8:18AM\nBritain needs training system that prepares young people for work, says BCC\nAmid surging worklessness, the British Chambers of Commerce\u2019s deputy director of public policy Jane Gratton said:\nThe labour market is continuing to give mixed signals as the number of vacancies declines for the 25th time alongside persistently high levels of economic inactivity and falling unemployment.\nEmployment costs also remain a major concern for employers, with real wage earnings still rising strongly, amid widespread recruitment difficulties and ongoing competition for skilled workers.\nBridging the UK\u2019s long-standing skills gap will be crucial to bringing more balance to the labour market.\nThe focus must be on creating an education and training system that properly prepares young people for the world of work. It must help adults to return to work, stay in work, and continuously upskill and reskill for a rapidly changing workplace.\nAs hundreds of thousands of students receive A-level, T-level and vocational qualification results this week, employers will be eager to bring new talent into their businesses.\nThey will be looking beyond the technical and academic achievements to assess people\u2019s real-world work-readiness and development potential.\n8:10AM\nUK markets open higher after unemployment surprise\nThe FTSE 100 began the day higher despite a surprise drop in unemployment, which has seen traders rein in bets on interest rate cuts.\nThe UK\u2019s blue chip stock index rose 0.3pc to 8,238.48 while the midcap FTSE 250 gained 0.4pc to 20,706.83.\nUnemployment unexpectedly fell to 4.2pc in the three months to June, down from 4.4pc and well below analyst estimates of a rise to 4.5pc, which would have raised pressure on the Bank of England to cut interest rates.\nTraders have reduced bets on a rate cut at the next meeting in September to less than 38pc from 39pc on Monday and 44pc on Friday.\n8:02AM\nJob vacancies fall amid pressure on employers\nAnother decline in vacancy rates also showed continued pressure in the UK jobs market.\nThe number of vacancies in the UK decreased by 26,000 to 884,000 for the three months to June.\nEstimates for the number of payrolled employees in the UK increased by 14,000 between May and June, the Office for National Statistics said.\nThere were 884,000 job vacancies in May to July 2024, down 26,000 on the quarter and 141,000 on the year. It is still 88,000 above pre-#COVID levels, though.\nRead Vacancies and jobs in the UK \u27a1\ufe0f https://t.co/WSm1QFuHck pic.twitter.com/wuH1wSmgah\n\u2014 Office for National Statistics (ONS) (@ONS) August 13, 2024\n7:55AM\nUK staff \u2018more in touch with mental health challenges\u2019\nBritain\u2019s workforce is \u201cmore in touch with mental health challenges than ever before\u201d, the Government has been told as it faces the task of solving the UK\u2019s worklessness crisis.\nThe gross number of people out of work and not looking for a job rose to 9.5m in the three months to June, its highest since 2011, while the seasonally adjusted number -which removes calendar-related variation - hit 9.4m.\nJulia Turney, partner at Barnett Waddingham, said:\nThe UK labour market continues to face persistent challenges as the country continues to deal with an ageing, disengaged, and economically inactive population.\nAnd in June, the economically inactive - the number of working-age people not actively looking for work - rose to a whopping 9.41m across the UK; a 350,000 increase from 2023.\nThe workforce we are dealing with today is older, increasingly remote, and more in touch with mental health challenges than ever before.\nIn fact, earlier this year Mental Health UK found that in the past year, 1 in 9 UK adults had experienced high levels of stress that contributed to them also taking time off work during that period.\nAnd so, if we are to meet the Government\u2019s ambitious goal of \u2018rebuilding our country\u2019 and strengthening the labour market, we must tackle these issues head on. This will not only require a concerted effort in promoting wellbeing and resilience in organisations across the country, but targeted support from the Government to reduce the economically inactive, and get us back on track.\n7:45AM\nUnemployment lower than a year ago, says ONS\nONS director of economic statistics Liz McKeown said:\nBasic pay growth, while remaining relatively strong, continues to slow.\nGrowth in total pay slowed markedly, with last year\u2019s one-off NHS bonuses affecting the comparison.\nThere was a fall in the unemployment rate, which is now lower than a year ago.\nMeanwhile, there was a modest increase in both the total numbers of people in employment and the number of employees on payroll in the latest quarter.\nHowever, the medium-term picture remains somewhat subdued with the employment rate still lower than a year ago and the growth rate in the number of payrolled employees having slowed over the year.\nThe number of job vacancies continues to decline, although the total number remains above pre-pandemic levels.\n7:40AM\nUK jobs market illustrates \u2018dire inheritance\u2019, says minister\nLiz Kendall has described the latest labour market data as \u201cyet more evidence of the dire inheritance we face\u201d.\nThe Work and Pensions Secretary said:\nThis is yet more evidence of the dire inheritance we face, with millions of people denied the support they need to get work and get on at work, harming their opportunities and holding back growth.\nThis Government will deliver the change the country is crying out for by making work pay, transforming skills, overhauling jobcentres and giving local areas the power they need to drive jobs and growth.\n7:37AM\nUnemployment unexpectedly falls in blow to hopes for interest rate cuts\nThe rate of unemployment fell to 4.2pc in the three months to June, official figures showed, in a potential blow to hopes for interest rate cuts.\nThe rate was down from 4.4pc in the previous three months, the Office for National Statistics has said.\nIt had been expected to rise to 4.5pc and the surprise drop sent the value of the pound higher as it reduces the likelihood of the Bank of England cutting interest rates at the next meeting in September.\nSterling was up 0.3pc against the dollar to tip over $1.28.\n7:32AM\nWages growth slowest in two years\nWage growth has slowed to the lowest level in nearly two years, official data showed, in a sign the jobs market is slowing down.\nUK average regular earnings growth fell to 5.4pc in the three months to June, the Office for National Statistics said, which was the lowest level since August 2022 and down from 5.7pc in the three months to May.\nIt meant that wages were 2.4pc higher after taking inflation into account.\nPay excluding bonuses grew by 5.4% in the year to April to June 2024; including bonuses it was up 4.5%, though this comparison is affected by last year's one-off NHS bonus.\nRead Average weekly earnings in Great Britain \u27a1\ufe0f https://t.co/BjehERVy9A pic.twitter.com/Swggl5o65d\n\u2014 Office for National Statistics (ONS) (@ONS) August 13, 2024\n7:31AM\nWorklessness surges to 13-year high in blow for Starmer\nThe number of people out of work and not looking for a job has surged to a near record high, official figures show, in a blow to Sir Keir Starmer\u2019s hopes to get Britain\u2019s economy growing.\nMore than 9.5m people were classed as economically inactive in the three months to June, according to the Office for National Statistics.\nThe level of inactivity - a gross figure which has not been adjusted for the time of year - was the highest since 2011 and comes as 2.8m people were out of work through long-term sickness, which was close to record levels.\nChancellor Rachel Reeves said:\nToday\u2019s figures show there is more to do in supporting people into employment because if you can work, you should work.\nThis will be part of my Budget later in the year where I will be making difficult decisions on spending, welfare and tax to fix the foundations of our economy so we can rebuild Britain and make every part of our country better off.\n7:28AM\nGood morning\nThanks for joining us.

        "text": "Conduit Pharmaceuticals\u2019 will acquire three first-in-class assets from AstraZeneca under an exclusive licensing agreement between the two companies.\nConduit\u2019s stock price shot up by 123% following the 8 August announcement. The California, US-based company has acquired two HK-4 glucokinase activators\u2014AZD1656 and AZD5658, and AZD5904, a myeloperoxidase inhibitor (MPO).\nAstraZeneca had already progressed AZD1656 and AZD5904 through Phase I clinical trials for metabolic disorders including type 2 diabetes. Conduit plans to advance the two candidates into Phase II trials later in 2024, specifically focusing on autoimmune disorders. The company has also secured exclusive rights to develop AZD5904 for idiopathic male infertility.\nUnder the terms of the agreement, Conduit will issue shares of common stock to AstraZeneca and pay a share of future sublicence revenues while AstraZeneca will provide preclinical and clinical data and drug supplies.\nFounded in 2019, Conduit focuses on acquiring assets that have completed preclinical and clinical testing. The company progresses these candidates through Phase II trials and seeks to achieve exits through third-party licences, if successful.\nSee Also:\nJapan approves updated Covid-19 vaccine to tackle JN.1 variant\nFDA approves Roche\u2019s Tecentriq Hybreza for cancer\nIn March, Conduit opened a new laboratory space in Cambridge, England. According to the company, the space will be used to progress and expand upon its existing asset portfolio while also facilitating new intellectual property.\nIn the announcement accompanying the acquisition, Conduit\u2019s CEO David Tapolczay: \u201cWe are delighted to have entered into an agreement with AstraZeneca to secure the rights to develop AZD1656, AZD5658, and AZD5904. The potential of these assets to become important first-in-class medicines for patients is promising.\n\u201cGiven the data from AstraZeneca\u2019s clinical trials, we believe there is a strong rationale to initiate Phase II studies in multiple indications to progress to commercialisation of these assets.\u201d\nIn February 2024, AstraZeneca concluded its acquisition of China-based clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company Gracell Biotechnologies for a $1.2bn price tag. The acquisition was a strategic move to bolster its pipeline with cell therapies for cancer and autoimmune diseases.",

        "title": "Trials to watch: Four biologics concluding pivotal COPD trials",
        "author": "Abigail Beaney",
        "date": "Thu, 25 Jul 2024 11:28:51 GMT",
        "text": "The chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder (COPD) market has laid relatively dormant for the past few years until recently.\nSeveral biologics which have been given the greenlight in asthma have not met the mark in COPD, with both GSK and AstraZeneca facing hurdles.\n\u201cWe have seen this before, especially in the field of airway disease, asthma and COPD, the first round sometimes failed and then they tweaked the protocol, a slightly different patient population, or a different dose and it worked,\u201d says Dr. Michael Segel, attending physician in pulmonology at the Sheba Hospital, Israel.\nUK-based company Verona Pharma has just received approval for its COPD drug Ohtuvayre (ensifentrine). The candidate is the first novel treatment in a decade to get the greenlight from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). This comes after the FDA asked for more time to review Regeneron and Sanofi\u2019s Dupixent (dupilumab) in COPD, which if approved would be the first biologic approved in the indication.\nGSK\u2019s Nucala hopes for second time lucky\nGSK is hoping for a win in the Phase III MATINEE trial of its biologic Nucala (mepolizumab). The company filed to the FDA for approval of Nucala in 2018 but it was denied, with the agency saying it needed more evidence of efficacy.\nFollowing the earlier trials, METREX (NCT02105948) and METREO (NCT02105961), GSK said that Nucala was efficacious and that the number of eosinophils in a patient\u2019s blood may help doctors decide if mepolizumab will work for them. The METREX trial reported an 18% reduction in moderate to severe exacerbations, compared to placebo, but did not meet statistical significance in METREO.\nNucala was the first interleukin-5 (IL-5) inhibitor to be approved for marketing, getting a nod from the FDA as a treatment for severe asthma associated with elevated eosinophil levels back in 2015.\nThe MATINEE trial (NCT04133909) has enrolled 806 COPD patients aged over 40 without asthma who need inhaled corticosteroid (ICS), long-acting beta-agonists (LABA) and long-acting muscarinic antagonist (LAMA) treatments.\nThe biggest change in the MATINEE trial is that GSK has a more defined patient population which should yield better results, explains Asiyah Nawab, pharma analyst at GlobalData.\n\u201cThe MATINEE trial has been able to redefine the use of the agent, with more refined criteria on the population and entry criteria of COPD patients,\u201d says Nawab. \u201cIt is unfair to say that the failure of the METREX and METREO trial will predict the fate of Nucala\u2019s performance in the MATINEE trial, rather it is a learning-curve for GSK\u2019s R&D team to refine the parameters tested.\u201d\nThe subgroups selected in the MATINEE trial also line up with those of previously successful candidates adds Dr. Armeen Poor, physician for division of pulmonary and critical care medicine at NYC Health and Hospitals, New York.\n\u201cLooking at the subgroups, and looking at the subgroups where Dupixent excelled, these line up. As a result, I think that this will show a statistically and clinically significant benefit.\u201d\nAstraZeneca also hoping for success in second Phase III try\nThe story is similar for AstraZeneca, which is also hoping for a win in its third Phase III study of Fasenra (benralizumab). Two previous trials, GALATHEA (NCT02138916) and TERRANOVA (NCT02155660), both failed to meet the primary endpoints.\nThe RESOLUTE trial (NCT04053634) is investigating Fasenra in 645 patients with COPD who have had at least two moderate to severe exacerbations in the past year despite being on a controller (ICS, LABA, LAMA).\nThe primary endpoint of the trial is the annualised rate of moderate or severe COPD exacerbations.\nFasenra is also an IL-5 inhibitor which is approved for use in asthma.\nPoor says that AstraZeneca is now targeting a patient population who are more likely to respond, so there are high hopes for the recent Phase III trial.\n\u201cThe previous Phase III trials for COPD did not meet statistical significance for the 220 blood eosinophils cut off but there was an impressive benefit in those with 300 blood eosinophils and above. That is what AstraZeneca is evaluating now so I expect that to be successful. Depending on the degree of success, it could be looked on very favourably due to its eight-week dosing schedule,\u201d Poor explains.\n\u201cThe beauty of this particular biologic is the fact that is has been extremely well studied in asthma, which means that it is effective,\u201d says Nawab. \u201cThe challenge of this biologic is being able to identify the right subset of COPD patients. Perhaps some of the earlier studies were too narrow of a phenotype, however, the REOSLUTE study has been able to redefine these parameters.\u201d\nIf Fasenra makes it to market for COPD, Prof. Gerard Criner, chair of Thoracic Medicine and Surgery at the Lewis Katz School of Medicine, Temple University, says that the dosing schedule of one every two months will be a big win over the twice month Dupixent and once monthly Nucala.\nRoche holds hopes on pipeline candidate\nRoche is also pushing ahead with COPD before asthma for its investigative biologic astegolimab. The company is going against the grain compared to its competitors and hoping for an approval in COPD before gaining approval in the asthma setting, for which the candidate is in Phase II trials.\nThe Phase III ARNASA trial (NCT05595642) is investigating astegolimab with two different dosing regimens, once every four weeks and once every fortnight, versus placebo.\nThe trial, which estimates a final enrolment of 1,290 patients globally, has a primary endpoint of annualised rate of moderate and severe COPD exacerbations over the 52-week trial period.\nIn a Phase IIa study (NCT03615040), the candidate did not show statistical improvement between the treatment arm and placebo arm in the primary endpoint of exacerbation rate. Astegolimab is an IL-33 inhibitor.\nAlthough different to the more common pathway of gaining asthma approval first, there may be some sense in targeting COPD first says Segel.\n\u201cThe competition of biologics in asthma is fierce,\u201d says Segel. \u201cOf course, it all depends on what the data looks like in COPD \u2013 we are hearing that it is looking good but until you see the formal publication, you don\u2019t know.\u201d\nRoche\u2019s trial is not including a blood eosinophil count as part of the inclusion criteria, with Poor adding that the IL-33\u2019s could meet an unmet need of patients with lower eosinophil levels.\n\u201cIf they can really address that lower eosinophil group because that\u2019s where a big unmet need is right now. In patients with less than 300 cells per microliter,, IL-33 appear to be the leading targets to go after it. Dupixent is probably not going to be given on label for patients with eosinophils less than 300 cells per microliter,\u201d Segel says.\n\u201cIt certainly does appeal to a wider range of COPD patients due to its mechanism of action. IL-33 agents can be promising as it blocks the action of IL-33 in the upper respiratory route, which is far different from blood eosinophils, hence its use in a wider range of patients,\u201d Nawab explains.\nSanofi and Regeneron put in second bid\nSanofi and Regeneron, who continue to wait for FDA approval for Dupixent in COPD, are putting in a bid for a second biologic in the COPD market.\nThe AERIFY-1 (NCT04701983) and AERIFY-2 (NCT04751487) Phase III trials are investigating the candidate in former and current smokers, aged 40 and over.\nDupixent is an IL-4 and IL-13 inhibitor, with the candidate targeting a specific population of people with evidence of type 2 inflammation. Meanwhile, itepekimab is a fully human monoclonal antibody that binds to and inhibits IL-33, an initiator and amplifier of broad inflammation in COPD.\nThe alarmin pathway which IL-33 targets has high potential explains Criner, who believes the long term benefits could also be a decrease in the risk of lung cancer which is highly prevalent amongst COPD patients.\n\u201cThe potential for the alarmin pathway is much more robust than the peripheral blood eosinophil for several reasons. If you can abrogate the cycle of inflammation and repair to the epithelium, you can over time perhaps not only decrease exacerbation rate but transform the biology of the disease progression,\u201d Criner explains. \u201cAnother thing is COPD and lung cancer are connected and a potential benefit of these drugs long term is that they could decrease the risk of cancer.\u201d",

        "text": "AstraZeneca has been dealt a blow after its flagship breast cancer drug Truqap (capivasertib) did not improve overall survival (OS) in a Phase III TNBC trial.\nThe Truqap and chemotherapy (paclitaxel) combo in the Phase III CAPItello-290 trial failed to meet its dual primary endpoints of improvement in OS versus chemotherapy and placebo in either the overall trial population or in a subgroup of patients that had tumours with specific biomarker alterations (PIK3CA, AKT1 or PTEN).\nAccording to research, mutations in PIK3CA, AKT1 and alterations in PTEN affect approximately 35% of patients with TNBC.\nThe Phase III, double-blind, randomised trial (NCT03997123) evaluated the efficacy of Truqap in combination with chemotherapy in patients with locally advanced (inoperable) or metastatic TNBC.\nThe safety profile of Truqap in combination with paclitaxel in CAPItello-290 was broadly consistent with the known safety profile of each medicine.\nSee Also:\nCharting the road to operational success in clinical trials\nWorld Sepsis Day 2024: need remains for improved trial design and targeted drugs\nAstraZeneca\u2019s executive vice-president for oncology R&D, Susan Galbraith, said: \u201cWhile we are disappointed in the CAPItello-290 outcome, these results will further our understanding of the role of the PI3K/AKT pathway in breast cancer as we continue our clinical research across the Truqap clinical development programme and across our pipeline.\u201d\nTruqap is a first-in-class adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-competitive inhibitor of all three AKT isoforms (AKT1/2/3).\nAstraZeneca has other ongoing Phase III trials for the drug, one in breast cancer, CAPItello-292, (NCT04862663) and two in prostate cancer in CAPItello-280 (NCT05348577) and CAPItello-281 (NCT04493853).\nThis recent blow comes after Truqap received approval from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2023, in combination with Faslodex (fulvestrant) for patients with hormone receptor-positive (HR+), human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 negative (HER2-) locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer with one or more AKT pathway mutations.\nWhile AstraZeneca originally hoped for approval for all HR+/HER- patients, the FDA only approved Truqap for patients with AKT pathway mutations despite statistical significance in its primary endpoint in the wider patient population.\nThe same combination was also recommended for approval in Europe in April 2024.\nThis more limited approval from the US body was due to the smaller effect on PFS in the wider population and the unfavourable safety profile, with 13% of patients discontinuing treatment in the experimental arm of the trial compared with just 2.3% in the placebo arm, as per GlobalData analysts.\nGlobalData is the parent company of Clinical Trials Arena.\nElsewhere in TNBC trials, Merck & Co (MSD) recently reported that its Phase III KEYNOTE-522 trial (NCT03036488) of its flagship drug Keytruda to treat high-risk, early-stage TNBC met its OS endpoint.",

        "author": "GlobalData Healthcare",
        "date": "Mon, 17 Jun 2024 19:53:57 GMT",
        "text": "On 16 June, 2024, during the European Hematology Association (EHA) 2024 Hybrid Congress in Madrid, Spain, new positive results from the randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase III ECHO clinical trial were presented on AstraZeneca\u2019s Calquence (acalabrutinib).\nThe trial tested the drug in combination with chemoimmunotherapy, bendamustine and Roche/Biogen\u2019s MabThera (rituximab) as first-line therapy for mantle cell lymphoma (MCL). The trial results suggest that this Calquence combination therapy could become a new standard-of-care (SOC) for older patients (>65 years) with MCL, who are ineligible for autologous stem cell therapy, as it shows potential to extend survival for the first time.\nMCL is a rare and often severe form of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) that develops when B lymphocytes transform into malignant cells in the mantle zone of a lymph node and is frequently diagnosed in the late stages. MCL accounts for about 5% of NHL cases. According to GlobalData\u2019s epidemiology data, MCL has an annual incidence rate of one per 100,000 population across the seven major markets (the US, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, the UK, and Japan). Calquence is a next-generation selective irreversible Bruton\u2019s tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitor. It covalently binds a cysteine residue (Cys481) in the BTK active site and inhibits BTK enzymatic activity, suppressing malignant B-cell proliferation and survival.\nIn the ECHO trial, 598 patients (299 per arm) with a median age of 71 years, were evenly distributed between the experimental (acalabrutinib + bendamustine + rituximab; ABR) and control (placebo + bendamustine + rituximab; PBR) treatment arms. After a median follow-up of 45 months, the ABR arm had a higher overall response rate (91.0% vs. 88.0%) and complete response rate (66.6% vs. 53.5%) than the PBR arm. The median progression-free survival (PFS) was prolonged in the ABR arm (66.4 months vs. 49.6 months, HR 0.73, P=0.0160). The secondary endpoint, overall survival (OS), favoured ABR. However, it was not statistically significant (HR 0.86, P=0.27), and the trial will continue to evaluate OS.\nCovid-19 deaths influenced trial results, with both arms showing increased median PFS following censoring for Covid-19 deaths. In the ABR arm, the censoring reduced the risk of disease progression or death by 36%. The safety profiles were comparable, with an identical incidence of grade \u22653 adverse events (AEs) (88.9% for ABR and 88.2% for PBR). Covid-19-related events and pneumonia were more common in the ABR group, resulting in a higher discontinuation rate for AEs (42.8% vs. 31.0%). During the presentation, the investigator mentioned that 80% of patients in both trial arms received the Covid-19 vaccination.\nSee Also:\nJapan approves updated Covid-19 vaccine to tackle JN.1 variant\nFDA approves Roche\u2019s Tecentriq Hybreza for cancer\nAccording to GlobalData\u2019s analyst consensus forecast, Calquence will generate global sales of over $4bn by 2030. Currently, several BTK inhibitors are in Phase III clinical trials as front-line therapy for MCL patients, including BeiGene\u2019s Brukinsa (zanubrutinib), Eli Lilly\u2019s Jaypirca (pirtobrutinib), InnoCare\u2019s Inokai (orelabrutinib), and AbbVie/J&J\u2019s Imbruvica (ibrutinib). If Calquence receives FDA label expansion in MCL, it will achieve a unique position in the treatment-naive MCL market share.\nHowever, this will depend on how quickly AstraZeneca can file for FDA approval, as AbbVie/J&J had to withdraw the accelerated FDA approval because a Phase III confirmatory trial (SHINE) revealed no OS advantage and a 7% increase in the risk of death in the Imbruvica arm. Another next-generation BTK inhibitor competitor to watch for, as first-to-market Imbruvica has lost favor, is Brukinsa, which can get ahead in the race if it shows superior efficacy and safety profiles compared to Calquence plus chemoimmunotherapy.",

        "text": "Wall Street loves coming up with cute little phrases, whether that be \u201cFANG\u201d or the more recent Magnificent 7. However, Thornburg portfolio manager Nicholas Anderson would like investors to be familiar with a new concept: targeting the best Fantastic 5 stocks for potentially blistering upside.\nFocused on European mega-capitalization plays, these five enterprises have delivered market-beating performance recently. We\u2019re talking about companies with a market value exceeding $200 billion. Yet even with this tremendous weight, these select firms have nimbly risen above the muck. Even better, many investors still aren\u2019t giving these ideas the time of day.\nThat could spell opportunity for the astute investor looking for the next arena in which to grow their funds. By moving in now, people can building a position before the crowd wakes up. With that in mind, below are (possibly) the best Fantastic 5 stocks to consider.\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\nAstraZeneca (AZN)\nSource: Shutterstock\nOne of the world\u2019s biggest biopharmaceutical firms, AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) focuses on the discovery, development, manufacture and commercialization of prescription medicines. Fundamentally, AstraZeneca represents one of the best Fantastic 5 stocks thanks to the perpetually relevant narrative. Basically, wealth accrual means little without health. Therefore, the sector should command perpetual investment dollars. And AstraZeneca features an enviable product portfolio along with advanced acumen.\nEven better, the performance of AZN speaks for itself. Since the second half of April this year, shares have been flying. In turn, analysts rate AstraZeneca a unanimous strong buy with an $85.80 price target.

        "title": "AstraZeneca/Fibrogen\u2019s Roxadustat FDA Review Further Delayed Following Unanticipated Advisory Committee Request",
        "author": "GlobalData Healthcare",
        "date": "Fri, 12 Mar 2021 17:12:50 GMT",
        "text": "FDA Delays Decision on AstraZeneca/Fibrogen\u2019s Roxadustat for CKD Anemia\nOn March 1, AstraZeneca and FibroGen announced that the FDA had requested a last-minute advisory committee (AdCom) meeting to review roxadustat\u2019s new drug application (NDA) in chronic kidney disease (CKD) anaemia. The announcement came as a surprise, as the drug\u2019s revised PDUFA date was imminent. The FDA had previously extended the NDA\u2019s initial review period by three months, setting an action date of March 20, 2021. Roxadustat is an oral hypoxia-inducible factor prolyl hydroxylase inhibitor (HIF-PHI). Despite the uncertainty triggered by the news, GlobalData believes a decision for an AdCom to be held does not translate negatively to the drug\u2019s chances for a successful FDA approval; rather, the AdCom will most likely shed more light on roxadustat\u2019s potential safety over current standard-of-care injectable erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs).\nThere are currently three HIF-PHIs currently in late-stage development in the US, including Akebia\u2019s vadadustat and GlaxoSmithKline\u2019s daprodustat. All three HIF-PHIs have already gained approval in Japan while roxadustat has also been approved in China. The decision for convening an AdCom is more likely related to the FDA deciding to take a more cautious stance given that roxadustat is the first drug of its class to be reviewed by the FDA. Importantly, current standard-of-care ESAs have historically been associated with increased risks of cardiovascular safety events, prompting the FDA numerous times to strengthen their safety information. Cardiovascular safety, however, has also been a topic of investigation for HIF-PHIs. For example, while roxadustat has demonstrated a non-inferior safety to placebo in non-dialysis dependent (NDD) patients in pooled analyses of data from six global pivotal Phase III trials, the competing HIF-PHI vadadustat failed to meet the primary safety endpoint, defined as non-inferiority of vadadustat versus darbepoetin alfa in time to the first occurrence of a major adverse cardiovascular event (MACE) in the Phase III PRO2TECT trial in NDD patients. Topline results of this study were presented in September 2020, shortly before roxadustat\u2019s initial December PDUFA date. While roxadustat will likely secure approval in both NDD and dialysis-dependent (DD) patients based on favourable data, the AdCom will also guide the FDA\u2019s decision on the drug\u2019s precise labelling.\nThe novel class is seen as a promising new addition to the treatment of CKD anaemia due to the several potential benefits they confer against current ESAs, mainly their oral route of administration. If approved in the US, HIF-PHIs are expected to put pressure on ESAs such as Amgen/J&J\u2019s Epogen/Procrit (epoetin alfa), Amgen\u2019s Aranesp (darbepoetin alfa) and Roche\u2019s Mircera (methoxy polyethylene glycol-epoetin beta). However, longer-term safety data will determine the extent of their impact on ESA patient shares and solidify their position within the CKD anaemia treatment paradigm.\nRoxadustat was approved in China in 2018 and 2019 in DD and NDD adult patients, respectively. In Japan, the drug was approved in 2019 and 2020 in DD and NDD, respectively.",

        "text": "AstraZeneca has highlighted both the economic and environmental benefits of implementing early, targeted screening for chronic kidney disease (CKD).\nCKD is a long-term condition where the kidneys gradually lose function, leading to buildup of waste in the body. It often results from diabetes, high blood pressure, or glomerulonephritis, and advanced CKD causes fatigue, swelling and altered urination. Untreated CKD can progress to end-stage renal disease, necessitating dialysis or a kidney transplant.\nAstraZeneca developed the blockbuster diabetes treatment Farxiga (dapagliflozin), a drug that nabbed an expanded label in CKD in 2021. The company is aiming to help reduce progression to kidney failure by 20% by 2025.\nSpeaking to Pharmaceutical Technology, senior vice president, global cardiovascular, renal and metabolism (CVRM), biopharmaceuticals business unit at AstraZeneca, Mina Makar, emphasised the importance of early diagnosis.\n\u201cIt\u2019s very important that we start to screen and diagnose early. If you think about CKD, you\u2019re talking about 800 million plus patients throughout the world. It\u2019s one of the biggest disease areas and only about 10% are diagnosed today,\u201d explained Makar.\nSee Also:\nJapan approves updated Covid-19 vaccine to tackle JN.1 variant\nFDA approves Roche\u2019s Tecentriq Hybreza for cancer\nData from AstraZeneca\u2019s IMPACT CKD modelling study, show the economic benefit of implementing early, targeted screening for CKD. The modelling analysis shows the potential for $16.95bn (\u20ac15.8bn) in savings over ten years by preventing cardiovascular events across healthcare systems in Germany, the Netherlands, Spain, and the United Kingdom.\nMakar highlighted that keeping patients off dialysis is a main priority: \u201cWe\u2019re trying to reduce patients starting on dialysis because it\u2019s a very difficult outcome for a patient and their family. It\u2019s life changing to be at that level of kidney decline.\u201d Makar went on to say the number of patients who need dialysis is projected to keep increasing as the population ages and targeting that is a high priority for the company.\nA second analysis of IMPACT CKD study demonstrated the importance of targeted screening and guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT) for patients at a high risk of CKD. A forecasted reduction in the incidence of undiagnosed CKD, dialysis, cardiovascular events, and mortality could be forecasted across the studied countries with these measures compared to current practices.\nIn addition to being costly, kidney dialysis has a significant environmental impact due to its high energy and water usage. Each dialysis session can consume 120-200 litres of water and significant energy while generating considerable single-use plastic waste.\n\u201cIf you add up all of the environmental burden of dialysis, it is one of the highest environmental burdens on the health care system,\u201d said Makar.",

        "text": "The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) of the European Medicines Agency (EMA) has recommended approving AstraZeneca\u2018s Tagrisso, in combination with chemotherapy, for the first-line treatment of adults with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).\nThe Tagrisso regimen is intended for treating patients with locally advanced or metastatic epidermal growth factor receptor-mutated (EGFRm) NSCLC whose tumours exhibit exon 19 deletions or exon 21 (L858R) mutations.\nThe committee\u2019s positive opinion is based on results from the open-label, randomised, multicentre, international Phase III FLAURA2 clinical trial.\nThis study assessed Tagrisso in combination with pemetrexed and platinum-based chemotherapy in 557 patients across 150 centres in 20 countries.\nPatients in the trial received 80mg of Tagrisso once daily, along with pemetrexed and a choice of cisplatin or carboplatin every three weeks for four cycles, followed by maintenance therapy with Tagrisso and pemetrexed.\nSee Also:\nMK-8189 by Merck for Schizophrenia: Likelihood of Approval\nAvelumab by Merck for Angiosarcoma: Likelihood of Approval\nProgression-free survival (PFS) was the trial\u2019s primary endpoint while overall survival (OS) is being evaluated as a secondary endpoint.\nThe interim trial results demonstrated that the Tagrisso regimen lowered the disease progression or death risk by 38% versus Tagrisso monotherapy.\nThe median PFS was 25.5 months for the combination therapy, showing an improvement of 8.8 months over the monotherapy, which had a median PFS of 16.7 months.\nAlthough the overall survival data remained immature, with only 41% maturity at the second interim analysis, there is an encouraging trend towards an OS benefit with the combination therapy compared to Tagrisso alone.\nThe safety profile of the combination therapy was found to be manageable and in line with the known profiles of the individual treatments.\nCommenting on the EMA CHMP recommendation, AstraZeneca oncology research and development executive vice-president Susan Galbraith stated: \u201cThe news reinforces the importance of Tagrisso as the backbone therapy in EGFR-mutated lung cancer.\n\u201cIf approved in Europe, patients will have the option to be treated with Tagrisso alone, or with chemotherapy, which is especially important when caring for patients whose disease has spread to the brain or those with L858R mutations.\u201d\nTagrisso is already approved in more than 100 countries, including the US, EU, China and Japan, for indications including first-line treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic EGFRm NSCLC, locally advanced or metastatic EGFR T790M mutation-positive NSCLC and adjuvant treatment of early-stage EGFRm NSCLC.\nIn May 2024, AstraZeneca signed a global licence and option agreement with Nona Biosciences for a preclinical monoclonal antibody.",

        "date": "Thu, 29 Aug 2024 00:00:00 GMT",
        "text": "Dive Brief:\nQiagen said Wednesday it has expanded its collaboration with AstraZeneca to cover companion diagnostics for chronic diseases.\nThe agreement, which moves the partnership beyond oncology, tasks Qiagen with developing and validating a genotyping assay for Qiastat-Dx. Qiagen currently uses the platform for infectious disease testing.\nQiagen has identified companion diagnostics as a double-digit growth opportunity and said Qiastat-Dx sales rose 12% in the second quarter.\nDive Insight:\nAstraZeneca began working with Qiagen on a cancer companion diagnostic 10 years ago. Oncology has remained the main use for companion diagnostics because many new cancer medicines are only effective in patients with certain biomarkers. The targeted therapies require tests that identify patients with those biomarkers, such as the diagnostic that Illumina won approval for this week.\nAlmost all the companion diagnostics authorized by the Food and Drug Administration support cancer drugs. There are exceptions though, with the list featuring hemophilia and obesity tests, and the use of companion diagnostics beyond cancer could increase if other treatments become more targeted.\nAstraZeneca has partnered with Qiagen to develop a test for its genomically targeted medicines. Qiagen said the goal is to enable specialty care providers to perform genotyping while patients are undergoing routine clinical examination. The genotyping could show if a patient is suitable for treatment with one of AstraZeneca\u2019s medicines.\nThe project involves Qiastat-Dx, a platform that uses real-time PCR to detect and differentiate between biomarkers in around one hour. Qiagen has developed cartridges for identifying the cause of respiratory, gastrointestinal and central nervous system infections. Neither AstraZeneca nor Qiagen has said what chronic disease the test will identify.\nQiagen landed the deal in the aftermath of a quarter in which Qiastat-Dx drove growth at the company. Sales of the platform grew 12% on a constant currency basis, CFO Roland Sackers said on an earnings call at the start of August. Sackers said the result reflected \u201csignificant gains in consumables and an ongoing good level of instrument placements.\u201d Qiagen expects to report Qiastat-Dx sales of at least $100 million in 2024.",

        "title": "3 Pharmaceutical Stocks That Can Surge Higher Even if The Markets Correct",

        "text": "In This Article:\nPFE\nAZN\nMRK\nThe outlook for pharmaceutical stocks has been mixed in the last five years. During the pandemic, the early-movers in the vaccine race gained as compared to others. However, sentiments turned significantly negative for the pharmaceutical sector in a post-covid world. I believe that pharmaceutical stocks are poised for a strong comeback in the next 12 to 24 months.\nThere are two major reasons for this view. First, the world faces macroeconomic and geopolitical headwinds. It\u2019s likely that the markets will be volatile and there will be phases of sharp corrections. I therefore expect portfolio readjustments to low-beta stocks and pharmaceutical names are likely to benefit.\nFurther, some of the major pharmaceutical companies have focused on building a deep clinical pipeline. Through organic and acquisition driven initiatives, some of the best pharma stocks seem poised for growth. It\u2019s therefore likely that pharmaceutical stocks will trend higher from attractive valuations.\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\nLet\u2019s therefore discuss three pharmaceutical stocks that are likely to trend higher even if the broad markets remain depressed.\nPfizer (PFE)\nSource: Manuel Esteban / Shutterstock.com\nAfter a sharp correction last year, Pfizer (NYSE:PFE) stock has remained sideways for YTD. This is an early indication of the stock bottoming out. At a forward P/E of 10.8, PFE stock looks undervalued and offers a dividend yield of 5.88%.\nFrom the perspective of product pipeline, Pfizer reported 33 phase three and 27 phase two candidates. Overall, the pipeline was at 113 programs as of June. With more than $10 billion in annual research and development spending, the pipeline is likely to translate into revenue growth in the next few years.\nIt\u2019s also worth noting that for Q2 2024, Pfizer reported healthy numbers. Revenue was at $13.3 billion, which was higher by 3% on a year-over-year basis. The company\u2019s oncology revenue increased by 27% and is likely to be the key growth driver for the next few years.\nFurther, with the commencement of the first phase of the \u201cmanufacturing optimization program,\u201d the company is \u201csetting the foundation for future margin expansion.\u201d Given these factors, PFE stock seems undervalued and poised for a strong reversal rally.\nAstraZeneca (AZN)\nSource: Roland Magnusson / Shutterstock.com\nAstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) stock has been in an uptrend with returns of 22% for YTD. However, considering the expected earnings growth, AZN stock remains attractively valued. Fresh exposure can be considered at current levels.",

        "text": "Antibody drug conjugates (ADCs) have taken over the cancer clinical research and dealmaking landscape, with new partnerships and agreements being announced regularly. As traffic increases in the ADC space, companies are differentiating themselves by using new targets and linkers.\nFree Report\nHow is the Biopharmaceutical industry evolving?\n2021 was a year of continued innovation and change in the Biopharmaceutical industry. As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to take its toll on businesses worldwide, it\u2019s time to look for new ways to create value, prepare for the future, and remain competitive in the...\nRead more\nBy GlobalData\nSince 2023, ADCs have dominated the highest-value pharmaceutical deals with companies such as MSD and Daiichi Sankyo spending billions of dollars to expand their ADC pipelines. Aside from investments from pharmaceutical giants such as AstraZeneca and Bristol Myers Squibb, smaller biotechs are also finding purchase in the space as innovation stirs.\nHow well do you really know your competitors?\nAccess the most comprehensive Company Profiles on the market, powered by GlobalData.

However, we want you to make the most beneficial decision for your business, so we offer a free sample that you can download by submitting the below form\nBy GlobalData\nSuch innovation was visible at this year\u2019s Annual American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) meeting, held from 31 May to 4 June. The 2024 conference highlighted data from blockbuster ADCs such as Pfizer\u2019s Adcetris (brentuximab vedotin), Gilead Sciences\u2019s Trodelvy (sacituzumab govitecan-hziy), and Daiichi Sankyo/AstraZeneca\u2019s Enhertu (trastuzumab deruxtecan).\n\u201cThere are so many novel targets, so many excellent results coming out in Phase III that is quite hard to call [which therapies will be successful],\u201d says David Thurston, PhD, a professor of drug discovery at the Institute of Pharmaceutical Science at King\u2019s College London, London, UK.\nAccording to GlobalData, there are 12 US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved ADCs for various cancer types whilst 53 ADCs are in ongoing Phase II and III studies.\nGlobalData is the parent company of Pharmaceutical Technology.\nADCs therapies are typically composed of a monoclonal antibody covalently bonded to a cytotoxic drug using a chemical linker. Traditionally, the therapies have been investigated for their use in different cancers, but in recent times this has been broadened to other therapy areas. ADCs have increased the ability to solubilise drugs and enhance the payload that can be delivered to target sites, says Dr. David Segarnick, the CMO of the medical solutions company Medistrava.\nThe rise of ADCs\nIn 2000, Pfizer became the first pharmaceutical company to have an ADC approved by the FDA. But the agency withdrew the therapy, Mylotarg (gemtuzumab ozogamicin), from the market in 2010 after confirmatory trials were unable to verify the therapy\u2019s clinical benefit, and the agency was alerted of further safety concerns. After the drug\u2019s dosing regimen was updated, the FDA reapproved the therapy in 2017.\nSince Mylotarg\u2019s development, ADC technology has massively improved as researchers have improved the drug-antibody ratios (DARs) of new ADC therapies, says Thurston. DARs describe the number of drug molecules attached to an antibody in an ADC. Researchers have evolved from developing therapies that deliver one molecule of the drug payload for each antibody molecule to eight molecules of the drug payload.\nThe Swiss biotech AC Immune is developing morADCs, which can enable single or dual-targeting strategies. For central nervous system (CNS) applications, the company\u2019s morADC platform can combine molecules that are individually designed to target and disrupt pathological forms of proteins like Abeta, Tau or a-syn, Andrea Pfeifer, the CEO of AC Immune, tells Pharmaceutical Technology in an email.\n\u201cI think the biggest news that stimulated the large number of agents in development was the deal between Daiichi and AstraZeneca for Enhertu,\u201d says Segarnick. The $6.9 billion 2019 deal gave AstraZeneca partial rights to Daiichi\u2019s ADC, which received its first FDA approval soon after in 2020. Enhertu uses a Her2-targeting monoclonal antibody linked to a DNA topoisomerase inhibitor payload. Segarnick said its arrival was a gamechanger due to its high efficacy in Her2 high-expressing and Her2 low-expressing breast cancer types.\n\u201cEnhertu had a much more stable conjugate that was more reproducible than the earlier generation of ADCs,\u201d says Segarnick. He explains the therapy had a more stable linkage, which reduced the toxicity of the therapy.\nThe AstraZeneca-Daiichi deal was one of the bigger ones that drove the market to peak in 2019, when the total values of ADC-related deals reached over $1.6 billion. During this time, several ADCs received FDA approvals, explains Thurston, citing Roche\u2019s lymphoma ADC Polivy (polatuzumab vedotin-piiq), and Astellas Pharma /Seagen\u2019s urothelial cancer therapy Padcev (enfortumab vedotin) as examples of this.\nBetween 2017 and 2019, the FDA approved five of the 12 currently available ADCs.\nThis period was also the peak time during which investors \u201cthrew money\u201d at small and mid-sized biotechs to support the development of their ADC assets, explains Thurston. ADC dealmaking fell during the pandemic, but the subsequent rise in 2023 signals a recovery in the market and growing interest in the space, says Segarnick. Seagen, the co-developer of Padcev, was acquired by Pfizer for $43bn in 2023.\nSegarnick labels ADC research surrounding Trop2 receptors as an exciting area of development. \u201cThese Trop2 membrane glycoproteins are integrally involved in the cellular signal transduction cascade, signals for cellular proliferation, potential, invasion, and survival,\u201d he says. Several companies are investigating the target for non-small cell lung cancer, with Gilead Sciences investigating its blockbuster Trop2-targeting therapy Trodelvy in the Phase III EVOKE-2 trial (NCT05186974).\nHowever, despite recent progress, issues surrounding the toxicities of certain ADCs remain, explains Segarnick. In their labels, the FDA has warned patients of the risk of interstitial lung disease associated with Enhertu and Boehringer Ingelheim/Roche\u2019s Kadcyla. \u201cBecause the ADC is cleared in the liver, we also see some serious Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia. There is a delicate balance to be met in the drug antibody ratio in order to limit this toxicity,\u201d says Segarnick. He adds that thus far, it seems that as the DAR increases these issues worsen for patients, which the industry is closely monitoring.\nStanding apart in a crowded market\n\u201cEveryone is looking for a new, novel target that can differentiate you from other companies and that will work well for a particular type of cancer,\u201d says Thurston. He explains that most ADC companies currently use the same few targets for oncology.\nOne ADC-focused biotech in the space is Natick, Massachusetts-headquartered company GO Therapeutics, which has focused its energy on targeting cancers in novel ways. Dr. Hans Wandall, the company\u2019s CSO, says the company has found \u201cnovel, clean targeting\u201d for triple negative breast cancer. Constantine Theodoropulos, GO Therapeutics\u2019 CEO, says one of the biotech\u2019s main priorities was to differentiate itself by developing a \u201csuper clean tumour antigen\u201d. The company is approaching first-in-human clinical studies of two of its ADC therapies in approximately 18 months. The company has developed GOL100 to target a novel glycoprotein epitope expressed on 30% of all breast cancers, and GOR800, which targets a novel glycoprotein epitope expressed on 30% of multiple solid tumors.\nGenentech, a division of Roche, has taken a different approach by investigating ADC technology that will allow site specific conjugation, says Thurston. Site specific conjugation involves the engineering of reactive sites into an antibody, ensuring that the drug binds to the intended location on the antibody. This offers advantages in terms of manufacturing due to the \u201ccleanness of the product\u201d, explains Thurston.\nDr. Hong Wan, the CEO of the San Francisco, California-headquartered Tallac Therapeutics, highlights her company\u2019s unique approach to minimise toxicity. The biotech is developing toll-like receptor agonist ADCs that have novel oligonucleotide payloads. The company\u2019s first program for its solid tumor asset, TAC-001, is unique in that rather than killing cells, it activates immune cells, says Wan. The therapy is currently in Phase I development (NCT05399654) for cancer patients with advanced disease who have failed other therapies. \u201cWe have shown clinical benefit in this patient group\u2026 so we\u2019re really excited about the potential for TAC-001 in combination with the standard of care,\u201d adds Wan.\nThurston says ADCs have potential to disrupt other therapeutic areas as companies develop therapies for Alzheimer\u2019s disease and arthritis. With the advent of new innovation, the market is still \u201cuntapped\u201d, says Segarnick. \u201cThere is potential for high valuations because of the high unmet need,\u201d he says.\nCorrection: A previous version incorrectly described\nAndrea Pfeifer\u2019s comments on AC Immune\u2019s platform technology.

        "text": "The UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (Nice) has decided not to recommend Daiichi Sankyo and AstraZeneca\u2019s Enhertu, a treatment for advanced HER2-low breast cancer, for National Health Service (NHS) use.\nIn its final guidance, the regulator expressed disappointment that the companies have not proposed a cost-effective price for the therapy.\nThis decision marks the first time in six years that NICE could not endorse a breast cancer medication, breaking a series of 21 consecutive approvals.\nEnhertu\u2019s evaluation followed the same procedures as the approval for Talazoparib (Talzenna) to treat HER2-negative breast cancer, given in February 2024.\nThe price offered by the pharmaceutical companies did not meet the value criteria set by NICE for the NHS.\nSee Also:\nMK-8189 by Merck for Schizophrenia: Likelihood of Approval\nAvelumab by Merck for Angiosarcoma: Likelihood of Approval\nApproximately 1,000 patients could have benefited from Enhertu if it had been recommended.\nIn 2022, NICE revised its methods to emphasise treatments for severe diseases more heavily.\nSince then, 22 appraisals have been conducted using the new severity weighting, with 17 resulting in positive recommendations, including 15 for treating cancer.\nThis modification has also facilitated access to crucial drugs for cystic fibrosis, a change that was not feasible under the former appraisal methods.\nDespite the setback with Enhertu, 79% of cancer medicine appraisals under the updated methods have received recommendations, closely aligning with the 78% approval rate for all cancer appraisals since 2009.\nThe severity modifier, which replaced the end-of-life modifier, is currently under evaluation to monitor its effectiveness.\nNICE has indicated a willingness to reconsider Enhertu under its rapid review process if Daiichi Sankyo and AstraZeneca agree to lower the price to an acceptable level, with the potential for a decision in the early autumn of 2024.\nNICE medicines evaluation director Helen Knight stated: \u201cWe are deeply disappointed that we are unable to recommend Enhertu for use in the NHS for advanced HER2-low breast cancer.\n\u201cAs we\u2019ve always made clear, the fastest and only guaranteed way to get medicines like Enhertu to the patients who need them is for companies to offer a fair price.\n\u201cNICE and NHS England offered as much flexibility as possible, but the companies did not put forward a new price, so we have no choice but to publish our final decision which is not to recommend the medicine in this group of patients.\u201d\nThis development comes after NICE issued final guidance endorsing Boehringer Ingelheim\u2019s tenecteplase to treat acute ischaemic stroke for NHS use.",

        "date": "Fri, 26 Jul 2024 16:40:02 GMT",
        "text": "The US Food and Drug Administration\u2019s (FDA) Oncologic Drugs Advisory Committee (ODAC) has called for changes in how clinical trials are conducted for treatments involving surgery for early-stage non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).\nFree Whitepaper\nNon-Small Cell Lung Cancer - Global Clinical Trial Landscape (2024)\nIn 2022, there were an estimated 2.1 million cases of non-small cell lung cancer worldwide. However, new treatments in the pipeline could be the key to reducing its prevalence. Download the free report from leading CRO Novotech to get the latest insights on global...\nRead more\nBy Novotech\nIn the 25 July meeting, the ODAC highlighted that it\u2019s important to separately evaluate the effectiveness of each part of the treatment process, which includes pre-operative and post-operative phases.\nThe committee meeting \u2013 which ended with a 11\u20130 vote in favour of changing how perioperative trials are run\u2013 came after AstraZeneca proposed to use Imfinzi (durvalumab) as a treatment with chemotherapy both before and after surgery. The pharma giant conducted the Phase III AEGEAN study (NCT03800134) to support this label expansion.\nThe committee did not vote on Imfinzi\u2019s approval in this indication, but the overall majority suggested that it should be approved. Following a lengthy discussion as to whether there should be another trial, Ravi Madan, medical oncologist at the National Cancer Institute said: \u201cI think to delay this at this point is very complicated for patients and their providers.\u201d\nThe perioperative period refers to the time before, during and after surgery. The study showed that the perioperative use of the treatment reduced the risk of cancer returning, progressing, or causing death by 32% compared to using chemotherapy alone. However, the study did not allow for separate evaluation of the pre- and post-surgery phases, so it was unclear which part of the treatment was most effective.\nIn a briefing document released prior to the meeting, the FDA said it had advised AstraZeneca to design the study in a way that could assess the individual benefits of the treatment in both pre- and post-surgery settings, but this advice was not followed. The concern is that without this information, there could be unnecessary side effects from the treatment without understanding the additional benefits.\nThe FDA also highlighted its concern for \u201cthe potential for overtreatment for perioperative immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) regimens,\u201d in the briefing document.\nImfinzi was first approved for treating bladder cancer in 2017. Its label later was expanded to include more indications including unresectable NSCLC, small-cell lung cancer, metastatic NSCLC, and endometrial cancer, which came through in June 2024.\nIn September 2023, the FDA accepted the supplemental Biologics License Application (sBLA) for Imfinzi in the perioperative setting. It is already approved in the UK and Switzerland for this indication based on the AEGEAN trial. In a 25 July statement, the pharma giant highlighted these approvals and that the FDA is not bound by the ODAC\u2019s recommendation.\n\u201cWe are committed to working closely with the FDA to bring this novel immunotherapy option to patients that offers a flexible chemotherapy backbone,\u201d said Susan Galbraith, executive vice president of oncology R&D at AstraZeneca, in its statement.\nMSD\u2019s blockbuster drug Keytruda (pembrolizumab) plus chemotherapy gained FDA approval as a perioperative treatment for NSCLC in October 2023 based on the Phase III KEYNOTE-671 study (NCT03425643). Similar to AstraZeneca\u2019s AEGEAN, KEYNOTE-671 evaluated the drug for its neoadjuvant and adjuvant use or in the perioperative setting. However, the two coprimary endpoints in the MSD trial, which were met, were overall survival (OS) and investigator-assessed event free survival (EFS). AEGEAN on the other hand, measured EFS and pathological Complete Response (pCR) as coprimary endpoints, both in modified intent-to-treat (mITT) population.",

        "text": "NHS spending rules risk depriving Britain of new medicines, the boss of AstraZeneca has warned, amid a row over a decision to block its life-extending breast cancer drug.\nSir Pascal Soriot warned that access to medicine in England would \u201ctotally shrink\u201d without a review of how the NHS spending watchdog assesses new drugs and decides if they are value for money.\nHe said: \u201cThe methodology needs to be adjusted and patients need to get access to the medicines that can really change their life.\u201d\nIt comes amid a backlash over a decision by the NHS spending watchdog, the National Institute for Care and Health Excellence (Nice), to reject AstraZeneca\u2019s Enhertu drug for breast cancer.\nThe treatment has been found to double the life expectancy for terminal breast cancer patients, with trials also suggesting that the drug can cut the risk of terminal breast cancer spreading or growing by 38pc when compared with standard chemotherapy.\nHowever, the drug is not available for NHS patients in England and Wales because of the Nice decision. Campaigners have claimed that for thousands of women this has cut their lives short. The treatment is available in countries including Scotland, the United States and Romania.\nNice opted to block the new treatment for English patients in March after ruling that metastatic breast cancer, also known as stage IV breast cancer, was a \u201cmoderately severe disease\u201d. Because of this, it decided that AstraZeneca\u2019s breast cancer drug did not offer value for money.\nAt the time, the spending watchdog said the cost-effectiveness was \u201cabove the upper end of the range Nice considers an acceptable use of NHS resources\u201d.\nSir Pascal called on Sir Keir Starmer to investigate how these decisions are made, arguing that Nice had made an error in classifying stage IV breast cancer as \u201cmoderately severe\u201d. He added: \u201cEverybody would tell you it is a severe disease.\u201d\nThe AstraZeneca boss said the current methodology was proving a \u201croadblock\u201d which would affect many other drugs for cancer and other severe diseases. He said it risked pushing drug makers to invest less in Britain, adding: \u201cDeveloping medicine in our country doesn\u2019t really make a lot of sense \u2013 it\u2019s not very attractive if patients won\u2019t benefit.\u201d\nSir Pascal said: \u201cWe hope the new Government will consider this and that will be reviewed.\u201d\nThe pressure on the Prime Minister comes after previous warnings from AstraZeneca that the UK is becoming less competitive as a place for life sciences companies to invest.\nLast year he criticised the UK\u2019s \u201cdiscouraging\u201d taxes. In early 2023, AstraZeneca snubbed Britain for a new $400m (\u00a3314m) new drug factory, citing the less attractive investment environment.\nHowever, Sir Pascal had suggested that relations were thawing in recent months and progress had been made on making Britain a better place to invest. In March, AstraZeneca agreed to spend \u00a3650m on building a new vaccine factory in Liverpool and upgrading research labs in Cambridge.\nIt is currently in talks with the Government over a funding package for the scheme.\nHowever, Sir Pascal said there was still \u201cmore to be done\u201d to make Britain a better place to invest.\nHe added: \u201cCompanies like AstraZeneca and [rival] GSK are probably a bit different because we\u2019re rooted in the UK so our willingness to continue to invest is slightly higher than other companies.\n\u201cBut the life sciences ecosystem needs many companies from around the world to invest in the country.\u201d\nHe said access to medicines \u201cneeds to change in the UK\u201d for more of those businesses to keep spending in the country.\nSir Pascal added: \u201cNice has to change the scoring of diseases and that\u2019s where it has to start.\u201d",

        "text": "Key Takeaways\nAstraZeneca's second-quarter earnings beat expectations Thursday, and the drugmaker also lifted its guidance.\nLike its COVID-19 vaccine manufacturing colleagues Pfizer and Johnson & Johnson, AstraZeneca's revenue from vaccines fell year-over-year.\nDuring the quarter, the company said at its annual investor day that it believes the drugs in its development pipeline can boost revenue to $80 billion annually by 2030, compared to $45 billion in 2023.\nAstraZeneca (AZN) posted better-than-expected results for the second quarter and lifted its full-year guidance Thursday as revenue grew in nearly all of its product categories compared to the same time last year.\nThe pharmaceutical giant reported $12.94 billion in revenue for the quarter, just over 13% higher than last year's $11.42 billion and above the $12.54 billion analysts had projected, according to estimates compiled by Visible Alpha.\nNet income also increased more than analysts expected, to $1.93 billion from $1.82 billion last year. Analysts had expected a smaller increase to $1.84 billion.\nGuidance Lifted, Revenue Rises in Most Areas Aside From Vaccines\nSales grew for all of AstraZeneca's therapy areas like oncology and cardiovascular, renal, and metabolism (CVRM), aside from vaccines and \"other medicines,\" which fell by 57% and 11%, respectively. AstraZeneca and other pharmaceutical companies like Pfizer (PFE) and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) have reported lower vaccine revenue in recent quarters as demand has faded for the COVID-19 vaccine, which boosted revenue during the pandemic.\nThe company also updated its guidance for the full year on the back of the strong drug sales, expecting revenue and adjusted earnings per share (EPS) to each rise by a mid-teens percentage, compared to projections of a low-double-digit to low-teens increase previously.\nDuring its annual investor day during the quarter, AstraZeneca laid out its goals to increase revenue to $80 billion annually by 2030, nearly double the $45.81 billion the company reported in fiscal 2023, with a number of new drugs in testing.\n\"This is a clear reflection of the substantial growth potential we see from both our approved medicines and those in our late-stage pipeline,\" AstraZeneca CEO Pascal Soriot said. \"Already this year we have announced five positive, potentially practice-changing Phase III studies that are anticipated to meaningfully contribute to our growth.\"\nDespite the revenue beat and lifted guidance, AstraZeneca's American depositary receipts (ADRs) were 4% lower at $79.71 in pre-market trading Thursday following the release.",

Results from the 12-week primary evaluation period of the trial were published in The Lancet Haematology.2\nDr. Christopher Patriquin, Chair of the Canadian PNH Network and Assistant Professor of Medicine (Hematology) at the University of Toronto and Clinician Investigator at the University Health Network said: \"The approval of danicopan, an oral add-on therapy to ravulizumab or eculizumab, means that the subset of patients with PNH who have clinically significant extravascular hemolysis now have a new therapeutic strategy available to them. Dual complement inhibition can enable patients to remain on our current standard of care C5 inhibition to maintain disease control, while increasing hemoglobin and potentially further improving their quality of life.\"\nBarry Katsof, Founder and President of the Canadian Association of PNH Patients, said: \"This is very exciting news for Canadian PNH patients, as the approval of Voydeya now offers the subset of patients experiencing extravascular hemolysis while treated with eculizumab or ravulizumab an add-on therapy designed to address this condition and improve their quality of life.\"\nKaren Heim, General Manager of Alexion Canada, said: \"People living with a rare disease and their families deserve our unwavering commitment to developing and enabling access to therapies that can help them live longer, fuller lives. The approval of Voydeya is a testament to Alexion's commitment to continuous innovation, particularly in areas of great unmet need.\"\nThe ALPHA Phase III trial evaluated the efficacy and safety of Voydeya as add-on to Ultomiris or Soliris in patients with PNH who experienced clinically significant EVH. Results showed that Voydeya met the primary endpoint of change in hemoglobin from baseline to week 12 and all key secondary endpoints, including transfusion avoidance and change in Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy \u2013 Fatigue (FACIT-Fatigue) score.2\nResults from the ALPHA Phase III trial showed Voydeya was generally well tolerated, and no new safety concerns were identified. In the trial, the most common treatment-emergent adverse events were headache, nausea, arthralgia and diarrhea.2\nVoydeya has been granted Breakthrough Therapy designation by the United States (US) Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and PRIority MEdicines (PRIME) status by the European Medicines Agency (EMA). Voydeya has also been granted Orphan Drug Designation in the US, EU and Japan for the treatment of PNH. Voydeya has been approved in the US, EU and Japan, and regulatory reviews are ongoing in additional countries.\nNotes\nPNH\nPNH is a rare, chronic, progressive and potentially life-threatening blood disorder. It is characterized by red blood cell destruction within blood vessels (also known as intravascular hemolysis) and white blood cell and platelet activation, which can result in thrombosis (blood clots).4-6\nPNH is caused by an acquired genetic mutation that may happen any time after birth and results in the production of abnormal blood cells that are missing important protective blood cell surface proteins. These missing proteins enable the complement system, which is part of the immune system and is essential to the body's defense against infection, to 'attack' and destroy or activate these abnormal blood cells.4 Living with PNH can be debilitating, and signs and symptoms may include blood clots, abdominal pain, difficulty swallowing, erectile dysfunction, shortness of breath, excessive fatigue, anemia and dark-colored urine.4,7,8\nClinically Significant EVH\nEVH, the removal of red blood cells outside of the blood vessels, can sometimes occur in PNH patients who are treated with C5 inhibitors.9,10 Since C5 inhibition enables PNH red blood cells to survive and circulate, EVH may occur when these now surviving PNH red blood cells are marked by proteins in the complement system for removal by the spleen and liver.4,6,11 PNH patients with EVH may continue to experience anemia, which can have various causes, and may require blood transfusions.9,10,12,13 A small subset of people living with PNH who are treated with a C5 inhibitor experience clinically significant EVH, which results in continued symptoms of anemia and may require blood transfusions.4,7,14,15\nALPHA\nALPHA is a pivotal, global Phase III trial designed as a superiority study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Voydeya as an add-on to C5 inhibitor therapy Soliris or Ultomiris in patients with PNH who experience clinically significant EVH. In the double-blind, placebo-controlled, multiple-dose trial, patients were enrolled and randomized to receive Voydeya or placebo (2:1) in addition to their ongoing Soliris or Ultomiris therapy for 12 weeks. A prespecified interim analysis was performed once 63 randomized patients had completed 12 weeks of the primary evaluation period or discontinued treatment as of 28 June 2022. At 12 weeks, patients on placebo plus Soliris or Ultomiris were switched to Voydeya plus Soliris or Ultomiris, and patients on Voydeya plus Soliris or Ultomiris remained on this treatment for an additional 12 weeks. Patients who completed both treatment periods (24 weeks) had the option to participate in a two-year long-term extension period and continue to receive Voydeya in addition to Soliris or Ultomiris. The open-label period of the study is ongoing.2,16\nVoydeya (danicopan)\nVoydeya (danicopan) is a first-in-class, oral, Factor D inhibitor. The medication works by selectively inhibiting Factor D, a complement system protein that plays a key role in the amplification of the complement system response. When activated in an uncontrolled manner, the complement cascade over-responds, leading the body to attack its own healthy cells. Voydeya has been granted Breakthrough Therapy designation by the US Food and Drug Administration and PRIority MEdicines (PRIME) status by the European Medicines Agency. Voydeya has also been granted Orphan Drug Designation in the US, EU and Japan for the treatment of PNH.\nVoydeya is approved in the US, EU, and Japan as add-on therapy to ravulizumab or eculizumab for the treatment of certain adults with PNH.\nAlexion is also evaluating Voydeya as a potential monotherapy for geographic atrophy in a Phase II clinical trial.\nAlexion\nAlexion, AstraZeneca Rare Disease is focused on serving patients and families affected by rare diseases and devastating conditions through the discovery, development and delivery of life-changing medicines.

        "text": "Enhertu: A Promising New Drug for HER2-Positive Cancers\nEnhertu (trastuzumab deruxtecan), a HER2-targeting antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) bearing a deruxtecan (TOP1 inhibitor) warhead, was developed by Japanese pharmaceutical company Daichi Sankyo. A collaboration with AstraZeneca for the drug\u2019s further development and commercialisation was established in 2019.\nEnhertu is the second HER2-targeting ADC approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) after Roche\u2019s Kadcyla (ado-trastuzumab etamine), which was approved in 2013 for HER2-positive (HER2+) unresectable or metastatic breast cancer in the second line. Kadcyla is also approved as an adjuvant therapy for early breast cancer patients with residual disease. Enhertu has a drug antibody ratio (DAR) of eight, compared to Kadcyla\u2019s mean DAR of 3.5, making Enhertu more cytotoxic.\nUnlike Kadcyla, Enhertu elicits a bystander effect, with the deruxtecan warhead diffusing into tumour antigen-negative cells, making it a suitable therapy for cancers with heterogenous HER2 expression. The bystander effect also enables the killing of non-cancer elements of the tumour such as stromal or vascular cells, which further increases the tumour-killing potential. The high DAR and the bystander effect make Enhertu a promising therapeutic for cancers with low or heterogenous HER2 expression, giving it a clinical edge over Kadcyla.\nIn 2019, the FDA granted approval for the use of Enhertu in HER2+ breast cancer patients with unresectable or metastatic disease who had progressed on two prior lines of therapy. Enhertu\u2019s label is set to expand, replacing Kadcyla as a second-line therapy for unresectable or metastatic HER2+ breast cancer. That October, the FDA had granted Enhertu breakthrough therapy designation (BTD) as a second-line therapy for HER2+ unresectable or metastatic breast cancer based on the DESTINY-Breast03 Phase III trial, which showed the drug to be superior to Kadcyla.\nThe 12-month progression free survival (PFS) was 75.8% with Enhertu compared to 34.1% with Kadcyla, while the overall response rate (ORR) for Enhertu was 79.7% compared to 34.2% with Kadcyla. Daichi Sankyo and AstraZeneca are also investigating Enhertu in the first line, with a Phase II trial set up earlier this year. Future label expansion for Enhertu also include competing with Kadcyla in the adjuvant HER2+ breast cancer setting for patients with residual disease, with the DESTINY-Breast05 trial performing a head-to-head comparison of the two ADCs.\nMultiple clinical trials are also investigating the use of Enhertu for HER2-low (IHC1/2+ and FISH-) unresectable or metastatic breast cancers. Data from a Phase Ib trial reported a confirmed ORR of 37% with a median duration of response (DOR) of 10.4 months, suggesting this to be a potential therapeutic for this subset of patients. There are currently no approved HER2-targeting therapies for this indication.\nHow well do you really know your competitors?\nAccess the most comprehensive Company Profiles on the market, powered by GlobalData.

However, we want you to make the most beneficial decision for your business, so we offer a free sample that you can download by submitting the below form\nBy GlobalData\nIn January 2021, Enhertu received FDA approval for the treatment of locally advanced and metastatic gastric or gastric oesophagal junction (GEJ) adenocarcinoma that had progressed on a prior trastuzumab-based regimen. This was based on the DESTINY-Gastric01 Phase II study, which showed overall survival (OS) benefit of four months compared to standard of care (SOC) chemotherapy. This shows its superiority to Kadcyla, which showed no survival benefit when compared to SOC chemotherapy in the Phase III GATSBY study.\nCurrent evidence shows Enhertu to be a best-in-class HER2-targeting ADC, with the drug set to take the largest class share ahead of Kadcyla. In the HER2+ breast cancer setting, GlobalData forecasts annual revenue in the eight major markets (8MM, namely the US, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, UK, Japan and China) to exceed $1.42bn by 2030. Daichi Sankyo and AstraZeneca have a diversified clinical development programme for Enhertu across multiple indications, including non-small cell lung cancer, triple-negative breast cancer, HER2+ urethral cancer, HER2+ osteosarcomas, HER2+ endometrial cancer and HER2+ colorectal cancers. Several trials are exploring the use of Enhertu in combination with AstraZeneca\u2019s anti-programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) Imfinzi (durvalumab), after research by Daichi Sankyo showed that treatment with Enhertu increased tumour-infiltrating immune cells and tumour PD-L1 expression. A combination of the two therapies would further increase revenue for AstraZeneca.",

        "text": "When Ian Strachan first started informing patients of how to secure weight-loss drugs at his pharmacies, he quickly realised that demand was strongest among one particular group.\n\u201cIt was basically 50 and 60-year old women,\u201d says Strachan, who runs a cluster of pharmacies in the north of England.\n\u201cThey\u2019d heard about the obesity injections through shows like Loose Women so they had a general idea about how they worked.\u201d\nMany of them viewed the treatments as a lifeline after years of struggling to shift the pounds. \u201cThey had tried everything,\u201d says Strachan. \u201cWhat they needed was a magic bullet.\u201d\nThere was, however, one obvious deterrent. Despite Novo Nordisk\u2019s Wegovy or Eli Lilly\u2019s Mounjaro helping people lose between 15pc and 22.5pc of their body weight, some patients were steering clear of the drugs out of fear of weekly injections.\nRecommended\n Weight loss medication complete guide: From Wegovy to Mounjaro\n Read more\nNow, optimism is growing that this barrier will be removed by the introduction of once-daily weight-loss pills and the surging investment for developing them.\nWhile Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly have dominated the weight-loss drug market with their existing jabs, experts believe more lucrative opportunities lie ahead with pills.\nUp until now there has been limited progress on oral options, with companies struggling with a shortage of ingredients such as semaglutide.\nHowever, if executives are able to roll out the treatment more broadly, mass market demand is expected to soar.\n\u201cThe orals will play a very significant role,\u201d said Pfizer chief executive Dr Albert Bourla last September. \u201cNot everybody likes injections.\u201d\nEstimates suggest around a 10th of people are afraid of needles, although drug bosses believe the introduction of pills will hoover up far more customers than that. According to AstraZeneca chief Sir Pascal Soriot, at least 75pc of people would prefer to take pills over injections.\nThe British drugmaker is among a flurry of businesses racing to seize a slice of the market, alongside global giants including Pfizer, Roche and Boehringer Ingelheim, as well as biotechs such as Viking Therapeutics.\n AstraZeneca chief Sir Pascal Soriot believes at least 75pc of people would prefer to take pills over injections Credit: Chris Ratcliffe/Bloomberg\nAccording to figures from industry group Airfinity, around 230 weight-loss drugs are currently progressing through studies and trials. A substantial chunk of these are thought to be oral pills. While many of these trials are in the very early stages, some companies are within shooting distance of bringing their pills to market.\nEli Lilly is among the frontrunners, having recently moved its experimental weight-loss pill into the last stage of clinical tests. Findings suggest the pill \u2013 which could also be taken with food \u2013 could help people lose an average of 24pc of their body weight.\nHowever, it will not just come down to who is quickest to market.\nEmily Field, an analyst from Barclays, says rivals will still be able to gain traction despite the head start secured by Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly.\n\u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean companies like Roche and AstraZeneca can\u2019t also have multibillion-dollar products,\u201d she says. \u201cBecause the numbers are just so big.\u201d\nGoldman Sachs estimates that the weight-loss treatment industry will be worth around $130bn (\u00a3100bn) a year by 2030.\nOthers suggest it could end up being a similar market to female contraception, where patients ultimately work out which treatment is best for them.\nInvestors seem to be hedging their bets, as they back a range of different companies.\nFor years, Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk have enjoyed eye-watering rallies in their share price \u2013 up 157pc and 122pc respectively since mid-2022.\nHowever, when Roche set out results from its early-stage clinical trial last week, showing its daily obesity pill led to weight loss of 7pc in four weeks, shares jumped to their highest level in the past year.\nField says there is a clear sense of \u201cobesity momentum\u201d in the markets.\n\u201cI was talking to investors and they were saying, \u2018I don\u2019t like Roche, I don\u2019t think Roche is that good a stock, but you have to own it because you can\u2019t fight this momentum\u2019. You\u2019ve just got to get on the train or you\u2019ll get run over.\u201d\nThere is, equally, the argument that companies are developing better and better drugs, ones that help treat more than just people\u2019s weight but also other conditions.\nZealand Pharma, which is working on weight-loss pills, said its focus is not purely on helping people shed more pounds.\nChief executive Adam Steensberg told the Financial Times that the plan was to design treatments with \u201csimilar degrees of weight loss but the potential to better address specific [illnesses that occur with] obesity\u201d.\nMeanwhile, AstraZeneca has suggested it is planning to use its weight-loss pill in combination with its other medicines to help people not just lose weight but also tackle things like cardiometabolic diseases.\nA crucial aspect of this will be price. AstraZeneca\u2019s Sir Pascal said the aim was to make weight-loss pills cheaper than injections.\nProfessor Naveed Sattar, who was appointed to helm Britain\u2019s obesity-cutting programme last year, said this could be a game-changer.\nHe is expecting the next generation of weight-loss pills to be \u201csubstantially cheaper\u201d after taking into account the lower cost of storing pills and the fact manufacturers would not require needles.\n\u201cWe need to wait until we have the data but there could be an argument in using these to help prevent people from developing obesity in the first place,\u201d Sattar says. \u201cIt\u2019s becoming much harder for people to lead healthier lives without some conscious effort.\n\u201cThere\u2019s more food around and the opportunities to be physically active are less given we have cars \u2013 so people are struggling.\u201d\nHe hopes at least one or two pills are approved in the next five years: \u201cIt would really widen how much they can be used.\u201d\nIt is a view shared by Strachan, who says the pill version could send demand for weight-loss drugs into overdrive.\n\u201cPeople are generally frustrated with not being able to lose weight,\u201d Strachan says. \u201cWe are only at the tip of the iceberg.\u201d",

Adverse reactions at grade 3 and above included significant decreases in neutrophils and leukocytes.\nThe primary endpoint of the ongoing trial is PFS, and it will continue to evaluate overall survival as a secondary endpoint.\nUniversity of British Columbia medicine clinical professor and medical oncologist Dr Barbara Melosky stated: \u201cThe FLAURA2 trial showed results demonstrating that patients experienced a significantly longer time without progression than those patients on standard of care.\n\u201cThis approval is great news for physicians and patients and further helps us to match the right patient to the right treatment to get the best possible outcomes.\u201d\nTagrisso, a third-generation EGFR-TKI, has been used in treating 850,000 patients worldwide.\nIt has shown efficacy in NSCLC, including against central nervous system metastases.\nIn June 2024, the Japanese Pharmaceuticals and Medical Device Agency approved Tagrisso (osimertinib) plus chemotherapy as a first-line treatment for adults with NSCLC.",

The trial enrolled 557 patients, showing that Tagrisso and chemotherapy reduced the risk of disease progression or death by 38% by investigator assessment compared to Tagrisso monotherapy, which is the first-line global standard of care.\nAdditionally, median progression-free survival was 25.5 months for patients treated with Tagrisso plus chemotherapy, an 8.8-month improvement versus monotherapy.\nProgression-free survival (PFS) results from a blinded independent central review (BICR) were consistent with the results by investigator assessment, showing 29.4 months median PFS with Tagrisso plus chemotherapy, a 9.5-month improvement over Tagrisso monotherapy.\nSee Also:\nJapan approves updated Covid-19 vaccine to tackle JN.1 variant\nFDA approves Roche\u2019s Tecentriq Hybreza for cancer\nThe Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) of the European Medicines Agency (EMA) recommended approving Tagrisso last month. The drug earned AstraZeneca $5.8bn in sales last year, as per the company\u2019s financials. According to GlobalData\u2019s Pharma Intelligence Centre, Tagrisso is forecast to generate $7.4bn in 2030.\nGlobalData is the parent company of Pharmaceutical Technology.\nCurrently, AstraZeneca\u2019s Imfinzi (durvalumab) is the standard of care for patients with stage III EGFRm NSCLC, but studies have shown that administering immunotherapy to patients with EGFRm is associated with very low response rates.\nIn the announcement accompanying the approval, AstraZeneca oncology business executive vice president Dave Fredrickson said: \u201cThis approval reinforces Tagrisso as the backbone therapy in EGFR-mutated lung cancer either as monotherapy or in combination with chemotherapy. This is especially important for those with more aggressive disease, including patients whose cancer has spread to the brain and those with L858R mutations.\u201d\nTagrisso combined with chemotherapy is already approved for the first-line treatment of locally advanced or metastatic EGFRm NSCLC in the USA, China, Japan, and other countries. It is also approved as monotherapy in more than 110 countries, including in the USA, EU, China, and Japan, for locally advanced or metastatic EGFRm NSCLC, EGFR T790m positive NSCLC, and as an adjuvant therapy for early-stage EGFRm NSCLC.\nNote: The stanfirst has been updated to reflect the correct PFS data.",

        "text": "AstraZeneca has committed to $80m in non-dilutive funding to Swiss biotech SixPeak Bio, which is developing a bispecific antibody therapy for weight loss.\nThe funding will be disbursed over the next two years. As part of the funding agreement, AstraZeneca will retain exclusive rights to acquire SixPeaks during this period. Though the companies did not disclose the \u201cagreed upon\u201d price for the acquisition, they did state that AstraZeneca can execute the buyout at the time of the investigational new drug (IND) application submission for the lead candidate.\nConcurrent with the AstraZeneca deal, SixPeaks also raised $30m in a Series A round. The funds will be used to develop a pipeline of weight loss therapies. The lead candidate is a bispecific antibody that targets activin type IIA and IIB receptors, which are responsible for regulating muscle mass. The therapy is expected to overcome the common side effect of muscle loss that occurs with glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) agonists that dominate the obesity treatment space.\nIn preclinical models, SixPeak\u2019s lead therapy has shown muscle mass preservation in lean and obese mice, both as a monotherapy and in combination with GLP-1 agonists. The company has also reported that the lead molecules have shown \u201cimproved potency, biophysical properties, and pharmacokinetics / pharmacodynamics, as well as reduced off-target binding compared with competing antibodies\u201d in preclinical studies.\nGLP-1 obesity therapies have generated millions in sales. Novo Nordisk is the current leader in the space and its obesity drugs, Wegovy and Saxenda (liraglutide), generated DKr41.6bn ($6bn) in combined global sales in 2023, as per the company\u2019s Q4 financials. GlobalData estimates that GLP-1 receptor agonist sales for the type 2 diabetes (T2D) and obesity markets will reach more than $125bn in 2033.\nSee Also:\nCharting the road to operational success in clinical trials\nWorld Sepsis Day 2024: need remains for improved trial design and targeted drugs\nGlobalData is the parent company of Pharmaceutical Technology.\nThis isn\u2019t AstraZeneca\u2019s first foray into the obesity space. In November 2023, the company signed a licensing agreement worth up to $2bn with Eccogene. The agreement was to develop and commercialise a GLP-1 agonist, ECC504, which is being evaluated in Phase I clinical trials as a treatment for obesity, T2D and other comorbidities.\nOther pharma giants are also making waves in this space. Last week, Roche reported positive results from the Phase Ib trial of its GLP-1/GIP receptor agonist for obesity and T2D. Another early contender is Viking Therapeutics\u2019 GLP-1/GIP receptor agonist, which was studied in a Phase II trial that met its primary and secondary endpoints.",

        "date": "Mon, 24 Jun 2024 13:30:00 GMT",
        "text": "In This Article:\nPFE\nAZN\nMRK\nThere are multiple reasons to consider exposure to pharmaceutical stocks for the long-term portfolio. First, pharma stocks have a low-beta and provide and help in reducing the overall beta of a portfolio that\u2019s overweight growth stocks. Further, pharma stock represents a business that\u2019s relatively immune to economic shocks.\nAt the same time, well established pharma companies have healthy cash flows and therefore sustained value creation through dividends. With these factors in consideration, investors should look at undervalued pharma stocks for the portfolio.\nI must add here that the global disease burden has been rising. Pharmaceutical companies aggressively investing in research and development are likely to benefit from drugs launched for various conditions. The focus of this column is therefore on blue-chip pharma stocks with high financial flexibility to invest in building an attractive drug pipeline.\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\nGiven the low-beta factor, it\u2019s unrealistic to expect high returns. However, the undervalued pharma stocks discussed have the potential to beat index returns on a consistent basis.\nPfizer (PFE)\nSource: Manuel Esteban / Shutterstock.com\nPfizer (NYSE:PFE) stock is in a phase of peak pessimism and trades at a valuation gap. After a correction of almost 30% in the last 12 months, the biopharmaceutical stock trades at a forward P/E of 11.8. The stock also offers a healthy dividend yield of 6%. In my view, this is the best time to accumulate PFE stock for healthy total returns.\nThere is no doubt that Pfizer\u2019s growth has been impacted in a post-pandemic world as Covid-19 vaccine sales decline. At the same time, drugs going off-patent have impacted growth. However, at current valuations, these factors are discounted.\nIt\u2019s worth noting that Pfizer has been building base for the next stage of revenue acceleration. On the organic front, the pharma company has a deep pipeline of 113 molecular entities. With 37 candidates in phase three and three in the registration phase, there is visibility for growth as new drugs are commercialized.\nOn the inorganic front, Pfizer has pursued multiple acquisitions in the last 12 to 18 months.

        "text": "AstraZeneca has received approval for Truqap (capivasertib) in combination with Faslodex (fulvestrant) in the European Union (EU) for the treatment of certain advanced breast cancer cases in adults.\nThis marks a significant development for patients with oestrogen receptor (ER)-positive, HER2-negative breast cancer, who have experienced disease progression after endocrine-based therapy.\nThe European Commission\u2019s decision follows a favourable recommendation from the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP).\nIt is underpinned by results from the Phase III CAPItello-291 trial, which demonstrated a 50% reduction in the risk of disease progression or death when Truqap was used in combination with Faslodex, compared to Faslodex with placebo.\nThe double-blinded and randomised trial, which enrolled 708 patients, showcased a median progression-free survival of 7.3 months for the combination therapy versus 3.1 months for the placebo group. The safety profile observed was consistent with previous studies of the combination.\nSee Also:\nMK-8189 by Merck for Schizophrenia: Likelihood of Approval\nAvelumab by Merck for Angiosarcoma: Likelihood of Approval\nIt focused on the efficacy of Truqap in conjunction with Faslodex against a placebo plus Faslodex regimen.\nThe trial targeted a specific patient group: those with locally advanced or metastatic HR-positive, HER2-low or negative breast cancer, which had recurred or progressed post-aromatase inhibitor treatment.\nAstraZeneca oncology business unit executive vice-president Dave Fredrickson stated: \u201cTruqap is now the first and only AKT inhibitor approved in the European Union for patients with ER-positive breast cancer who have tumours harbouring these specific biomarkers.\n\u201cBreast cancer continues to be the leading cause of cancer-related death in Europe, and today\u2019s news represents a significant step forward in providing an important new treatment option for patients in need of new, innovative therapies.\u201d\nWith the approval, AstraZeneca\u2019s partner, Astex Therapeutics, stands to receive milestone payments upon the first commercial sale in the EU, and royalties on future sales.\nRegulatory reviews of Truqap and Faslodex are ongoing in China, with the combination already approved in the US, Japan and other regions based on the evidence from the CAPItello-291 trial.\nIn June 2024 the CHMP recommended the approval of AstraZeneca\u2018s Tagrisso, in combination with chemotherapy, for the first-line treatment of adults with non-small cell lung cancer.",

        "text": "Today, a brief rundown of news from Belharra Therapeutics, AstraZeneca, Regenxbio and Tasyha Gene Therapies.\nSanofi will work with biotechnology startup Belharra Therapeutics to develop small molecule drugs for inflammatory diseases, the companies announced Tuesday. Belharra will get $40 million in upfront and near-term payments to start the deal, through which it will use what it describes as \u201cnext-generation chemoproteomics\u201d to identify immune drug prospects. The alliance is the second for Belharra, which launched last year with $130 million in funding and a research pact in place with Genentech. \u2014 Ben Fidler\nAccess now\u2794\nTrendline\nInside the market of emerging biotech\nNew biotechs continue to emerge despite a challenging market environment that has forced venture firms to build their drug startups more cautiously.\nAccess now\u2794\nTrendline\nInside the market of emerging biotech\nNew biotechs continue to emerge despite a challenging market environment that has forced venture firms to build their drug startups more cautiously.\nAstraZeneca\u2019s bid to expand use of its new breast cancer drug Truqap has fallen short. In the Capitello-290 trial in \u201ctriple negative\u201d breast cancer, Truqap plus chemotherapy didn\u2019t help people live longer than did a placebo and chemotherapy. The drug is approved to treat people with hormone-receptor positive, HER2-negative breast cancer if they have certain genetic alterations, a setting where it recorded $50 million in sales in the first quarter of 2024. The U.K.-based drugmaker expects data from a trial in prostate cancer later this year. \u2014 Jonathan Gardner\nA gene therapy from Taysha Gene Therapies helped improve motor function in four people with the rare neurodevelopmental disorder Rett syndrome, the biotechnology company said Tuesday. The data are from two adult and two pediatric patients enrolled in a Phase 1/2 trial of Taysha\u2019s therapy, called TSHA-102. One of the treated adults sat up unassisted for the first time in over a decade, while researchers observed symptom benefits in the other participants. Taysha plans to next test higher doses of its therapy. \u2014 Ned Pagliarulo\nRegenxbio got agreement from the Food and Drug Administration on details of an accelerated approval application for a gene therapy the company is developing for the neurodegenerative disease Hunter syndrome. According to Regenxbio, the agency endorses the company\u2019s plans to use a neurological protein as a surrogate marker \u201creasonably likely\u201d to predict clinical benefit. It\u2019s also discussed with Regenxbio the design of a confirmatory trial that would start next year. The biotech plans to start submitting its application in the third quarter. Dubbed RGX-121, the therapy would be its first wholly owned treatment to reach market. \u2014 Ben Fidler\nAccess now\u2794\nTrendline\nInside the world of cell therapies\nThe continued emergence of CAR-T therapy has fueled research into next-generation approaches and new applications, such as its use in autoimmune diseases.\nThe FDA has partially halted testing of an antibody-drug conjugate BioNTech licensed last year from China-based biotech MediLink Therapeutics. The FDA is concerned that higher doses of the drug, which is being evaluated against breast and lung tumors, may lead to \u201cunreasonable and significant risk of illness and injuries,\u201d according to a regulatory filing from BioNTech. MediLink has stopped enrolling new patients in a Phase 1 trial in the U.S. while it addresses the FDA\u2019s concerns. \u2014 Ben Fidler",

        "text": "Today, we discuss three must-own stocks as major Wall Street indices reach new highs. The rise in share prices of technology stocks and supportive economic data hinting at potential Federal Reserve policy easing have contributed to investor optimism. So far in 2024, the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSEARCA:SPY), which tracks the S&P 500 index, is up 13%. Similarly, the Invesco QQQ Trust ETF (NYSEARCA:QQQ), which tracks the Nasdaq-100, rose 14% since January, while the SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF Trust (NYSEARCA:DIA), which tracks the Dow Jones Industrial Average, returned about 4%.\nCurrently, Wall Street is witnessing companies from a blend of traditional sectors, such as health care, industrials and consumer staples, maintain their strength. Meanwhile, stocks in new segments, such as artificial intelligence (AI), are emerging with promising prospects. Today, we examine three must-own stocks for the ride ahead in June and the rest of 2024.\nAstraZeneca (AZN)\nSource: Roland Magnusson / Shutterstock.com\nWe start our discussion of must-own stocks with the U.K.-based biopharma giant AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN). It has a diverse pipeline that includes oncology, cardiovascular, respiratory and other therapeutic areas. AstraZeneca boasts an impressive portfolio of over 180 projects, including 19 new molecular entities in its late-stage pipeline.\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\nFor the first quarter of 2024, AstraZeneca\u2019s total revenue grew 19% year-over-year (YOY) to $12.7 billion, reflecting the sustained demand for its medications. Earnings per share (EPS) also witnessed a notable 21% increase from the previous year, reaching $1.41.\nAstraZeneca\u2019s strategic move to invest $1.5 billion in a Singapore facility for antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) aims to enhance its oncology portfolio and spur future growth. Additionally, the acquisition of Fusion Pharmaceuticals, a company specializing in next-generation radioconjugates, underscores AstraZeneca\u2019s commitment to revolutionizing cancer treatment. Management is looking to replace traditional therapies with more targeted approaches, ultimately improving outcomes for cancer patients.\nSince January, AZN stock has surged nearly 20% and currently offers a 1.8% dividend yield. Yet, shares remain reasonably valued at 19 times forward earnings and 5.3 times sales. Wall Street remains optimistic, projecting a 12-month price target of around $85 for AZN stock, an upside potential of 5% from its current levels.\nCaterpillar (CAT)\nNext up on today\u2019s list of must-own stocks is Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT). The leading manufacturer of construction and industrial equipment is renowned for its strategic investments in sustainable technologies. Wall Street also loves CAT stocks\u2019 consistent dividend payouts.\nThe company\u2019s recent earnings revealed sales and revenues of $15.8 billion, nearly flat YOY, as the lower sales volume was offset by favorable price realization. Operating profit margin improved to 22.3%, while adjusted EPS increased to $5.60 from $4.91 in the prior-year quarter. Caterpillar generated $2.1 billion in operating cash flow and allocated $5.1 billion for share repurchases and dividends.\nExpanding beyond its core business, Caterpillar is venturing into electric and autonomous vehicles for construction. Earlier this year, CAT partnered with CRH (NYSE:CRH) to expedite the adoption of electric construction vehicles in North America. The agreement focuses on deploying Caterpillar\u2019s battery-powered, 70 to 100-ton off-highway trucks and charging infrastructure at a CRH site.\nSo far in 2024, CAT stock has gained around 11%, while shares are trading at 15 times forward earnings and 2.5 times sales. Analysts maintain a 12-month price target of $340 for Caterpillar stock, with a potential 4% upside. Additionally, CAT stock offers a 1.6% dividend and has consistently paid higher annual dividends for 30 consecutive years, earning recognition in the S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats Index.\nCoca-Cola (KO)\nSource: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.com\nWe conclude today\u2019s discussion of must-own stocks with Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO). With a diverse product range of drinks recognizable worldwide and over 60 consecutive years of dividend increases, the company stands out as a top stock pick on Wall Street.\nIn late April, Coca-Cola released first-quarter 2024 results, indicating resilience amid economic challenges and setting the stage for growth. Total revenues reached $11.3 billion, showing an 11% organic growth YOY. Adjusted EPS rose by 7% to $0.72.\nIn recent years, Coca-Cola\u2019s growth has been fueled not only by innovation and market diversification but also by offering healthier options. With a strong global presence and expansion into emerging markets like Latin America and Asia, the company maintains steady revenue growth. Recent Nielsen data confirms Coca-Cola\u2019s U.S. retail dominance, with 4.1% YOY sales growth, outperforming the total beverage group.\nYear-to-date, KO stock has returned roughly 8%, coupled with a healthy dividend yield of 3%. The shares are trading at 22.7 times forward earnings and 6 times sales. Finally, Wall Street has a 12-month median price forecast of $68.00, signaling an upside potential of 6%.\nOn the date of publication, Tezcan Gecgil did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "text": "Dive Brief:\nAn AstraZeneca and Daiichi Sankyo medicine didn\u2019t significantly extend survival in people with non-small cell lung cancer who were expected to benefit most from treatment, raising questions about whether U.S. regulators may approve the drug later this year.\nData presented at the World Conference on Lung Cancer Monday showed people with the nonsquamous form of non-small cell lung cancer and treated with datopotamab deruxtecan lived a median of 2.3 months longer than those who received chemotherapy in a Phase 3 trial. The findings represent a \u201cclinically meaningful trend\u201d towards improved survival, but didn\u2019t meet statistical significance, AstraZeneca said.\nThe Food and Drug Administration will decide by Dec. 20 whether to approve datopotamab deruxtecan as a second-line treatment for people with nonsquamous, non-small cell lung cancer. The new survival findings \u201cmake us suspicious about a straight approval,\u201d wrote Stifel analyst Eric Le Berrigaud in a Tuesday note to investors. A delayed decision and an advisory committee meeting appear to be \u201creasonable assumptions,\u201d he added.\nAccess now\u2794\nTrendline\nInside the market strategies of today\u2019s drugmakers\nNew drugs for obesity and Alzheimer\u2019s look set to become blockbusters, reshaping pharma marketing strategies just as many current top-sellers near looming patent cliffs.\nAccess now\u2794\nTrendline\nInside the market strategies of today\u2019s drugmakers\nNew drugs for obesity and Alzheimer\u2019s look set to become blockbusters, reshaping pharma marketing strategies just as many current top-sellers near looming patent cliffs.\nDive Insight:\nDatopotamab deruxtecan, or dato-dxd for short, is the product of a collaboration between AstraZeneca and Daiichi to develop precision cancer drugs known as antibody-drug conjugates.\nThe partners believe ADCs can supplant chemotherapy in many tumor types. Their drug Enhertu, a fast-selling medicine that\u2019s changed how certain breast cancers are treated, is a prime example. But unlike Enhertu, which was first approved in 2019 and has since succeeded in a variety of different trials, dato-dxd\u2019s case to regulators is less straightforward.\nAstraZeneca and Daiichi had hoped to bring the drug to market for all people whose non-small cell lung tumors express a protein, TROP2, that it\u2019s designed to target. That population would be a large market, as TROP2 is overexpressed in most types of lung tumors.\nYet expectations have since been dialed back. Dato-dxd delayed tumor progression in a Phase 3 trial testing it against the chemotherapy docetaxel in people who had received at least one prior therapy. But it didn\u2019t significantly extend survival in the overall study population. Some people who received dato-dxd and didn\u2019t respond had a \u201cdetrimental effect\u201d compared to docetaxel, suggesting they should be excluded from future testing and shouldn\u2019t receive it in a commercial setting, wrote Stifel\u2019s Le Berrigaud on Tuesday.\nAstraZeneca and Daiichi have focused on the drug\u2019s seeming benefit for people whose tumors are classified as nonsquamous, a group they believe could better benefit from treatment. They submitted an approval application for use in these patients specifically, and the Food and Drug Administration in February agreed to review it.\nStudy results revealed at WCLC, though, \u201cadd a layer of complexity\u201d to the companies\u2019 argument, according to Le Berrigaud. The difference in median survival between the 14.6 months reported for the nonsquamous group and the 12.3 months for people given docetaxel wasn\u2019t statistically significant, which \u201cmay be weighed by the FDA\u201d during its review, wrote Leerink Partners analyst Andrew Berens in a separate note.\nEfforts to better identify responders have also been complicated. AstraZeneca and Daiichi have been working with Roche on a diagnostic to measure levels of TROP2, and on Monday presented results from an after-the-fact analysis suggesting treatment benefits for people with so-called actionable genomic alterations. The latter group could help the companies secure an approval, albeit in a \u201climited population,\u201d Berens wrote.\n\u201cThere is an unequivocal benefit with dato-dxd for some patients, and at a reasonable price in terms of toxicity, but the exact target population and how it should be addressed are complex topics,\u201d Le Berrigaud added.\nAstraZeneca shares fell by as much as 5% during Tuesday trading on the London stock exchange.",

        "text": "Europe's top court has ruled against Apple (AAPL), ordering the iPhone maker to pay 13 billion euros ($14.4 billion) in back taxes to Ireland, and also upheld a 2.4-billion-euro ($2.7 billion) antitrust fine leveled at Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google; Oracle (ORCL) shares are jumping on better-than-expected quarterly results and a partnership with Amazon's (AMZN) cloud business; meme stock GameStop (GME) is expected to post declining second-quarter revenue and a wider loss after the bell; and AstraZeneca's (AZN) lung cancer drug trial underwhelms. U.S. stock futures are little changed. Here's what investors need to know today.\n1. Apple Loses EU Tax Case, Has to Pay $14.4B\nThe European Court of Justice ruled against Apple (AAPL) and said the iPhone maker had benefited from unfair tax breaks from the Irish government, setting aside an earlier ruling that overturned 13 billion euros ($14.4 billion) in underpaid taxes. Apple lost its final challenge of the European Commission's 2016 order to Dublin to recover the back taxes over \"illegal tax benefits\" from Ireland over the course of two decades. Shares of Apple, which unveiled its hotly anticipated artificial intelligence (AI)-powered iPhone 16 Monday, are falling 1% in premarket trading.\n2. Europe's Top Court Also Upholds Google's $2.7B Fine\nThe European Court of Justice also ruled against Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google, which had appealed a 2.4-billion-euro ($2.7 billion) fine for abusing its dominant position and favoring its own shopping services over those of its competitors. Europe's top court upheld a 2017 decision by the European Commission, the executive arm of the European Union (EU). Alphabet shares are little changed in premarket trading.\n3. Oracle Stock Surges on Q1 Results, Amazon Partnership\nOracle (ORCL) shares are jumping 8% in premarket trading after the enterprise software company posted better-than-expected fiscal first-quarter results and announced a partnership with Amazon's (AMZN) cloud business, Amazon Web Services. The software giant's stock has gained more than 30% this year, fueled by growing demand for its cloud services, particularly in AI applications.\n4. GameStop Expected to Post Wider Quarterly Loss After the Bell\nGameStop (GME), the video game retailer associated with the 2021 meme-stock craze, reports quarterly financial results after the closing bell Tuesday. Analysts expect the company to post declining revenue, a slightly larger net loss, and 23% lower comparable store sales compared with the second quarter of fiscal 2023. Shares are little changed in premarket trading.\n5. AstraZeneca Slips as Lung Cancer Drug Disappoints\nAstraZeneca (AZN) shares are slipping in premarket trading after a Phase 3 trial found the British pharmaceutical firm's lung cancer drug did not significantly improve patients' overall survival rates. The results from the TROPION-Lung01 trial showed that the overall survival rate \"did not reach statistical significance,\" the company said.\nDo you have a news tip for Investopedia reporters?

        "text": "Dive Brief:\nThe Food and Drug Administration has approved a new combination drug regimen from Johnson & Johnson to treat a common type of advanced lung cancer with certain genetic mutations.\nJ&J\u2019s Rybrevant is now cleared for use with another drug called Lazcluze in people with previously untreated non-small cell lung cancer that\u2019s metastasized or advanced locally. Only people with specific mutations in a gene known as EGFR are eligible for treatment.\nThe approval is based on results from a study that compared the combination to AstraZeneca\u2019s lung cancer drug Tagrisso. In a statement, J&J described the new treatment as the first chemotherapy-free regimen that\u2019s demonstrated superiority to Tagrisso in this setting.\nAccess now\u2794\nTrendline\nInside the world of cell therapies\nThe continued emergence of CAR-T therapy has fueled research into next-generation approaches and new applications, such as its use in autoimmune diseases.\nAccess now\u2794\nTrendline\nInside the world of cell therapies\nThe continued emergence of CAR-T therapy has fueled research into next-generation approaches and new applications, such as its use in autoimmune diseases.\nDive Insight:\nApproval of Rybrevant and Lazcluze introduces a new competitor to Tagrisso, widespread use of which in EGFR-mutated lung cancer has made it AstraZeneca\u2019s second highest-selling product.\nFor this reason, analysts closely watched MARIPOSA, the J&J study that compared the two regimens. Data, which was first released last September and published in June, showed J&J\u2019s combination reduced the risk of cancer progression or death by 30% compared to Tagrisso alone. Results from the June paper also suggested a lower relative risk of death.\nHowever, about 10% of patients given Rybrevant and Lazcluze discontinued treatment due to side effects, compared to 3% of those on Tagrisso. Investigators also reported a safety signal of venous thromboembolic events. As a result, the FDA is requiring patients receive prophylactic anticoagulation during the first months of therapy with J&J\u2019s regimen.\nCompetitively, the relevant comparator treatment may also have shifted since J&J ran its study. Testing by AstraZeneca has now shown that combining Tagrisso with chemotherapy can improve progression-free survival over Tagrisso alone.\nNon-small cell lung cancer, or NSCLC, is the most common form of the tumor type. Frequently, these tumors are driven to growth by mutations in the EGFR gene. Rybrevant and Lazcluze are approved to treat NSCLC tumors that test positive for certain mutations where pieces of genetic code have been deleted or substituted.\nRybrevant, which was first approved in 2021, is a bispecific antibody that binds to two different types of proteins. Lazcluze is an oral drug aimed at EGFR, and works by inhibiting a kind of enzyme that, among other functions, plays a role in the transformation of normal cells to cancerous ones.",

        "text": "AstraZeneca has received priority review from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for its supplemental Biologics License Application (sBLA) for Imfinzi to treat limited-stage small cell lung cancer (LS-SCLC).\nA regulatory decision on the approval of the therapy is expected by the fourth quarter of this year, under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act.\nThe application is supported by data from the Phase III ADRIATIC clinical trial in LS-SCLC patients whose disease did not progress after treatment with platinum-based concurrent chemoradiotherapy.\nAccording to the findings, Imfinzi cut down mortality risk by 27% compared to placebo.\nPatients treated with Imfinzi had an estimated median overall survival (OS) of 55.9 months, significantly longer than the 33.4 months observed in the placebo group.\nSee Also:\nMK-8189 by Merck for Schizophrenia: Likelihood of Approval\nAvelumab by Merck for Angiosarcoma: Likelihood of Approval\nAdditionally, 57% of patients on Imfinzi were alive at three years, compared to 48% on placebo.\nThe treatment also showed a 24% reduction in the risk of disease progression or death, with a median progression-free survival of 16.6 months for Imfinzi versus 9.2 months for placebo.\nAstraZeneca\u2019s Imfinzi has a generally manageable safety profile, with no new safety signals detected during the trial.\nThe FDA previously granted Imfinzi breakthrough therapy designation for the treatment of LS-SCLC.\nAstraZeneca Oncology R&D executive vice-president Susan Galbraith said: \u201cThis Priority Review reinforces the potential of Imfinzi to transform outcomes for patients as the first and only immunotherapy to demonstrate a survival benefit in limited-stage small cell lung cancer.\n\u201cThere is an urgent need for new treatment options that improve upon the standard of care in this setting, which has not changed in forty years, and we look forward to working with the FDA to bring Imfinzi to patients as quickly as possible.\u201d\nIn July this year, AstraZeneca closed the acquisition of Amolyt Pharma, a company specialising in treatments for rare endocrine diseases.\nAstraZeneca made a $1.05bn payment for all outstanding shares of Amolyt Pharma, free of cash and debt.\nThe transaction also comprised an upfront payment of $800m and an additional $250m contingent upon reaching a particular regulatory milestone.",

        "text": "Pharma giant AstraZeneca and UK biotech Aptamer Group are hoping to bolster the efficacy of small interfacing RNA (siRNA) therapies, using Aptamer\u2019s Optimer delivery system.\nThe companies did not disclose the financials behind the collaboration but following the 3 July announcement, Aptamer\u2019s shares were up by 18% to $0.95 (\u00a30.74).\nThe collaboration between the two UK-based companies will begin in pre-clinical stages, starting with lab data, before moving to animal studies. The Optimer system has already shown to be effective in fibrotic liver in in-vitro studies.\nThe companies would not confirm which indication they will be investigating at pre-clinical stages.\nWhile the more known and investigated messenger RNA (mRNA), used to develop the Covid-19 vaccinations, carries genetic information for protein synthesis, siRNA targets and silences specific genes with precision.\nSee Also:\nESMO: Moderna\u2019s mRNA solid tumour vaccine shows early promise\nGSK reports positive interim data from mRNA influenza vaccine trial\nA huge challenge that has faced drug developers however is off-target effects, where the siRNA may bind to unintended mRNA targets, leading to unintended gene silencing. As a result, a more effective delivery system would be hugely beneficial.\nAptamer claims that its Optimer technology could represent a \u2018paradigm shift\u2019 in the targeted delivery of siRNA molecules.\nCTO of Aptamer Group, Dr. Arron Tolley, said that these sorts of partnerships with big pharma will help the company make rapid progress with its Optimer technology.\nTolley said: \u201cIt is great to see large pharma businesses like AstraZeneca interested in Optimer technology and wanting to explore its potential as a non-viral vector.\u201d\n\u201cOur in-vitro dataset shows our Optimer delivery vehicle successfully overcomes challenges, selectively targeting activated hepatic stellate cells, the cells responsible for fibrotic liver disease, and not other cell types within the liver or other tissues. This enables the siRNA to be selectivity delivered into the fibrotic cells, relative to normal liver cells. The collaboration was initiated based on these results, and we will evaluate the performance of their siRNA molecule with our Optimer delivery vehicle for fibrotic liver, with the intention to move to animal studies.\u201d\nTolley added that Optimer is also being evaluated by a different top 15 pharma partner with the potential for licensing, and is gaining interest from other companies across the industry.\nsiRNA can be used as a therapeutic approach in various diseases, including oncology, fibrosis, neurological disorders, HIV, arthritis, Crohn\u2019s disease, ulcerative colitis, cardiovascular diseases, renal disease, metabolic disorders, respiratory diseases, and hepatitis C.\nThe first siRNA agent, Alnylam\u2019s Onpattro (patisiran), received US Food Drug Administration (FDA) approval in 2018. By March 2024, the FDA had approved five other agents, Alnylam\u2019s Givlaari (givosiran), Oxlumo (lumasiran) and Amvuttra (vutisiran), Novartis\u2019s Leqvio (inclisiran), Dicerna Pharmaceuticals Rivfloza (nedosiran).",

These patients are at a heightened risk of severe outcomes from the disease.\nThe EMA\u2019s Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) granted sipavibart an accelerated assessment due to its potential for public health and as a therapeutic innovation.\nThe submission for sipavibart is based on the positive outcomes from the Phase III SUPERNOVA clinical trial.\nSee Also:\nJapan approves updated Covid-19 vaccine to tackle JN.1 variant\nFDA approves Roche\u2019s Tecentriq Hybreza for cancer\nThis international, double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled trial analysed the efficacy and safety of sipavibart versus control (tixagevimab/cilgavimab or placebo).\nThe variants of Covid-19 observed during the trial included several different SARS-CoV-2 strains.\nSipavibart prevented symptomatic Covid-19 in immunocompromised individuals versus the control group.\nAstraZeneca is also engaging with other regulatory bodies to discuss potential authorisation or approval pathways for sipavibart.\nAstraZeneca vaccines and immune therapies executive vice-president Iskra Reic stated: \u201cImmunocompromised patients currently have no options for Covid-19 protection in Europe beyond vaccination, which often is not sufficient to protect them against serious Covid-19 outcomes.\n\u201cWe are pleased that the EMA has accepted this regulatory submission with an accelerated assessment procedure and will work to bring sipavibart to these highly vulnerable patients.\u201d",

        "text": "AstraZeneca\u2018s Imfinzi (durvalumab), in combination with chemotherapy, has received approval from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for treating adults with primary advanced or recurrent endometrial cancer that is mismatch repair deficient (dMMR).\nThe treatment regimen comprises Imfinzi plus chemotherapy including carboplatin and paclitaxel, followed by Imfinzi monotherapy.\nThis approval from the FDA is based on a subgroup analysis from the DUO-E Phase III trial, which focused on MMR status.\nThe randomised, multicentre, double-blind, placebo-controlled study assessed Imfinzi plus platinum-based chemotherapy followed by either Imfinzi monotherapy or Imfinzi plus Lynparza (olaparib), against chemotherapy alone.\nIt included 699 patients with newly diagnosed advanced or recurrent epithelial endometrial carcinoma.\nSee Also:\nMK-8189 by Merck for Schizophrenia: Likelihood of Approval\nAvelumab by Merck for Angiosarcoma: Likelihood of Approval\nPatients in the trial were randomised to receive Imfinzi or a placebo every three weeks, alongside platinum-based chemotherapy.\nResults showed that the Imfinzi combination regimen reduced the risk of disease progression or death by 58% in patients versus chemotherapy alone.\nImfinzi and chemotherapy regimen\u2019s safety profile was found to be generally manageable and well-tolerated, aligning with outcomes from previous trials without any new safety concerns.\nThe Lynparza and Imfinzi arm also met the trial\u2019s primary endpoint of progression-free survival (PFS).\nRegulatory submissions for the Imfinzi and Lynparza regimens are currently under review in regions and countries including the European Union and Japan, drawing from the data from the DUO-E trial.\nAstraZeneca oncology business unit executive vice-president Dave Fredrickson stated: \u201cThere have been limited advances in the treatment of endometrial cancer in the last few decades, and continued innovation is critical as the burden of this cancer is expected to grow in the future.\n\u201cImmunotherapy in combination with chemotherapy is emerging as a new standard of care in this setting, and the approval of Imfinzi offers an important new option for patients with mismatch repair deficient disease.\u201d\nThe latest development comes after the FDA approved AstraZeneca\u2018s Farxiga (dapagliflozin) for the treatment of paediatric patients aged 10 years and above with type-2 diabetes.",

        "text": "AstraZeneca has closed the acquisition of Amolyt Pharma, a company specialising in treatments for rare endocrine diseases.\nThe deal between the parties was announced in March 2024.\nAstraZeneca made a $1.05bn payment for all outstanding shares of Amolyt Pharma, free of cash and debt.\nThe transaction includes an upfront payment of $800m and an additional $250m contingent upon reaching a particular regulatory milestone.\nThe strategic move strengthens AstraZeneca\u2019s late-stage pipeline within its Alexion rare disease division and adds the investigational therapeutic peptide eneboparatide (AZP-3601) to its bone metabolism portfolio.\nSee Also:\nJapan approves updated Covid-19 vaccine to tackle JN.1 variant\nFDA approves Roche\u2019s Tecentriq Hybreza for cancer\nEneboparatide is in Phase III development for hypoparathyroidism and binds to the parathyroid hormone (PTH) receptor with high affinity.\nHypoparathyroidism is a rare condition defined by PTH deficiency that results in low calcium and elevated levels of phosphorus in the blood.\nClinical manifestations of this condition impact tissues and organ systems, specifically kidneys and bone.\nEneboparatide is a subcutaneous parathyroid hormone receptor 1 agonist for the treatment of hypoparathyroidism.\nIts therapeutic goals are to regulate serum calcium levels, manage hypoparathyroidism symptoms, reduce urine calcium excretion and potentially prevent kidney function decline and chronic kidney disease.\nIts short plasma half-life may help normalise bone turnover and maintain bone health.\nAnother candidate in Amolyt\u2019s pipeline is AZP-3813, a peptide growth hormone receptor antagonist being developed as a potential add-on to somatostatin analogues for the treatment of acromegaly, a condition associated with abnormally high secretion of growth hormone.\nAstraZeneca\u2019s rare disease portfolio generated $7.76bn in global sales in 2023, as reported in the company\u2019s fourth-quarter financial reports.",

        "text": "AstraZeneca has reported positive data from the ECHO Phase III clinical trial where its Calquence combination therapy (acalabrutinib) significantly improved progression-free survival (PFS) in patients with untreated MCL.\nThe combination therapy has also indicated a favourable trend in overall survival (OS) compared with the standard chemoimmunotherapy regimen comprising bendamustine and rituximab.\nThe double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled, multicentre trial is designed to assess the efficacy and safety of the Calquence regimen versus placebo plus standard-of-care chemoimmunotherapy in adult MCL patients aged 65 years or above.\nAccording to the findings, patients treated with the Calquence combination experienced a median PFS of 66.4 months, a notable increase from the 49.6 months observed in patients receiving standard chemoimmunotherapy.\nIn the secondary endpoint of OS, a positive trend for the Calquence combination was reported, although the data were not mature at the time of analysis.\nSee Also:\nESMO: Moderna\u2019s mRNA solid tumour vaccine shows early promise\nGSK reports positive interim data from mRNA influenza vaccine trial\nConducted during the pandemic, the ECHO trial included a pre-specified analysis that censored Covid-19-related deaths to assess their impact. This analysis revealed an even greater improvement in PFS, with the Calquence combination reducing the risk of disease progression or death by 36%.\nCalquence\u2019s safety and tolerability were in line with its known safety profile without any new safety signals detected.\nAstraZeneca Oncology R&D executive vice-president Susan Galbraith said: \u201cThe ECHO trial data demonstrate important progress in improving outcomes for patients with mantle cell lymphoma.\n\u201cThe 16.8 months of additional time patients can live without their disease progressing is highly clinically meaningful, together with a trend to improvement in overall survival. We therefore believe Calquence plus chemoimmunotherapy will be an important new option for patients living with this disease.\u201d",
