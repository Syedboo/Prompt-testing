        "text": "Sainsbury's and the Union of Shop, Distributive and Allied Workers (Usdaw) have warned that the UK retail sector is facing a crisis, with thousands of job losses and store closures imminent unless the government takes urgent action to reform business rates.\nA report commissioned by the two organisations has found that the current business rates system is unsustainable and that planned increases to the tax will accelerate the decline of the high street.\nThe research, conducted by Development Economics, predicts that 17,300 retail stores could close over the next decade.\nThe report also highlights the negative impact on the public purse, with an estimated \u00a35.5bn ($7.0bn) in lost tax revenue over the next ten years.\nHowever, it proposes a solution: a 20% cut in retail business rates.\nContrary to expectations, the report argues that this would increase government revenue by \u00a370m per annum due to increased economic activity and investment.\nIn addition, the report states that a 20% cut could also protect and create more than 17,000 retail jobs.\n\u201cAll responsible retailers want to pay their fair share of tax, but the current business rates system has become an enormous burden on our industry. It is no longer fit for purpose,\u201d said Simon Roberts, CEO of Sainsbury's.\n\u201cIt has failed to keep pace with major changes in how customers are now shopping and how much our retail industry has changed over the last decade. As a result, it is directly causing store closures and job losses across the sector.\n\u201cWe need a coordinated and inclusive approach, involving all key stakeholders,\u201d emphasised Paddy Lillis, general secretary of Usdaw.\n\u201cThe current business rates system is not fit for purpose, as it places bricks-and-mortar retailers at a significant disadvantage to online retail. In effect, this amounts to nothing more than an unfair tax on shops and action has to be taken to level the playing field.\nBoth Sainsbury's and Usdaw have urged the government to act swiftly to prevent further damage to the retail sector.\n\"Sainsbury\u2019s calls for business rates cut to boost UK retail\" was originally created and published by Retail Insight Network, a GlobalData owned brand.\nThe information on this site has been included in good faith for general informational purposes only.

        "text": "Key Insights\nGiven the large stake in the stock by institutions, J Sainsbury's stock price might be vulnerable to their trading decisions\nThe top 8 shareholders own 51% of the company\nAnalyst forecasts along with ownership data serve to give a strong idea about prospects for a business\nEvery investor in J Sainsbury plc (LON:SBRY) should be aware of the most powerful shareholder groups. We can see that institutions own the lion's share in the company with 52% ownership. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).\nSince institutional have access to huge amounts of capital, their market moves tend to receive a lot of scrutiny by retail or individual investors. Hence, having a considerable amount of institutional money invested in a company is often regarded as a desirable trait.\nLet's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about J Sainsbury.\nView our latest analysis for J Sainsbury\nWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About J Sainsbury?\nInstitutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.\nJ Sainsbury already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see J Sainsbury's historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.\nInvestors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power. Hedge funds don't have many shares in J Sainsbury. Looking at our data, we can see that the largest shareholder is Qatar Holding LLC with 14% of shares outstanding. Meanwhile, the second and third largest shareholders, hold 10% and 6.1%, of the shares outstanding, respectively.\nWe also observed that the top 8 shareholders account for more than half of the share register, with a few smaller shareholders to balance the interests of the larger ones to a certain extent.\nWhile studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.",

        "text": "UK-based supermarket Sainsbury's and Comic Relief have announced a major partnership aimed at tackling child food poverty in the country, particularly during the often-challenging school holiday periods.\nThe two organisations will collaborate to deliver more than one million meals to children facing food insecurity.\nSpecifically, a \u00a32.5m ($3.24m) investment will be channelled into supporting organisations on the ground, including Feeding Britain, The Bread and Butter Thing, and London Community Foundations.\nThese charities will use the funds to provide nutritious meals and enriching activities for children throughout the mid-year school break.\nAdditionally, the partnership will establish five new year-round food club hubs to address long-term food insecurity and support families beyond the holiday period.\nAccording to Sainsbury\u2019s, 900,000 English children struggle with food poverty despite not qualifying for free school meals.\nEven those who receive them go without year-round support, as the government's programme only covers four out of six school holiday weeks.\nResearch by the Department of Education also shows a concerning trend: children from low-income households are more likely to experience a \"holiday gap\" during school breaks.\nThis means they have fewer opportunities to participate in organised activities, face potential health issues due to lack of proper nutrition and exercise, and may experience social isolation.\nTo rally public support, Sainsbury's is launching a series of in-store initiatives throughout this month.\nCustomers can contribute by purchasing selected fruits and vegetables, with 25p from each sale donated to Comic Relief.\nMoreover, Mars Food is pledging \u00a3100,000 from Dolmio product sales to the cause.\nCustomers can also make direct donations at store checkouts or online.\nAs part of the campaign, Sainsbury's is offering free childrens' meals in its caf\u00e9s from 15 July to 3 September with the purchase of an adult hot meal.\nThis initiative is expected to provide approximately 18,000 meals to UK children.\n\u201cWe know that the school holidays are a difficult time for many families, especially for children who aren\u2019t eligible for free school meals. This is where our Nourish the Nation programme comes into play, with the aim of turning the school holiday experience from one of surviving to thriving,\u201d said Ruth Cranston, director of Corporate Responsibility & Sustainability at Sainsbury's.\n\u201cIn total this spring and summer, we will have committed to donating over \u00a34.2m to supporting children with access to nutritious food, through donations to Comic Relief.

        "title": "J Sainsbury plc's (LON:SBRY) Fundamentals Look Pretty Strong: Could The Market Be Wrong About The Stock?",
        "author": "",
        "date": "Thu, 04 Jul 2024 06:59:50 GMT",
        "text": "With its stock down 8.9% over the past month, it is easy to disregard J Sainsbury (LON:SBRY). However, the company's fundamentals look pretty decent, and long-term financials are usually aligned with future market price movements. Specifically, we decided to study J Sainsbury's ROE in this article.\nReturn on equity or ROE is an important factor to be considered by a shareholder because it tells them how effectively their capital is being reinvested. Put another way, it reveals the company's success at turning shareholder investments into profits.\nSee our latest analysis for J Sainsbury\nHow Do You Calculate Return On Equity?\nReturn on equity can be calculated by using the formula:\nReturn on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) \u00f7 Shareholders' Equity\nSo, based on the above formula, the ROE for J Sainsbury is:\n2.0% = UK\u00a3137m \u00f7 UK\u00a36.9b (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2024).\nThe 'return' is the profit over the last twelve months. So, this means that for every \u00a31 of its shareholder's investments, the company generates a profit of \u00a30.02.\nWhat Is The Relationship Between ROE And Earnings Growth?\nThus far, we have learned that ROE measures how efficiently a company is generating its profits. Depending on how much of these profits the company reinvests or \"retains\", and how effectively it does so, we are then able to assess a company\u2019s earnings growth potential. Assuming everything else remains unchanged, the higher the ROE and profit retention, the higher the growth rate of a company compared to companies that don't necessarily bear these characteristics.\nA Side By Side comparison of J Sainsbury's Earnings Growth And 2.0% ROE\nIt is quite clear that J Sainsbury's ROE is rather low. Even compared to the average industry ROE of 15%, the company's ROE is quite dismal. In spite of this, J Sainsbury was able to grow its net income considerably, at a rate of 23% in the last five years. We reckon that there could be other factors at play here. For example, it is possible that the company's management has made some good strategic decisions, or that the company has a low payout ratio.\nWe then performed a comparison between J Sainsbury's net income growth with the industry, which revealed that the company's growth is similar to the average industry growth of 23% in the same 5-year period.\nEarnings growth is a huge factor in stock valuation. The investor should try to establish if the expected growth or decline in earnings, whichever the case may be, is priced in. By doing so, they will have an idea if the stock is headed into clear blue waters or if swampy waters await. One good indicator of expected earnings growth is the P/E ratio which determines the price the market is willing to pay for a stock based on its earnings prospects. So, you may want to check if J Sainsbury is trading on a high P/E or a low P/E, relative to its industry.",

It expects full-year retail operating profit to grow between 5% and 10%.\nThis confidence stems from its ongoing cost-saving efforts and investments in technology.\nA noteworthy move is its partnership with Microsoft to leverage AI for enhancing customer experiences and improving operational efficiency.\nLooking ahead, Sainsbury's acknowledges the cautious consumer behaviour due to the ongoing cost-of-living crisis. It anticipates this trend to continue until interest rates potentially decrease.\nOverall, Sainsbury's Q1 results paint a mixed picture.

This would be the fourth time the vehicle has been recalled in the US.\nRead more: FTSE 100 LIVE: European stock markets fall as traders await eurozone inflation data\nThe disclosure revealed the number of vehicles affected by the recall \u2014 11,688 trucks \u2014 which would equate to the number of Cybertrucks sold, since it includes vehicles in use and in transit to customers. Because Tesla does not officially break out Cybertruck sales in its quarterly delivery report, getting a read on early Cybertruck sales is noteworthy.\nExtrapolating the numbers shows Tesla could deliver around 23,500 Cybertrucks this year. However, at its annual shareholder meeting two weeks ago, CEO Elon Musk disclosed Tesla achieved a production record of 1,300 Cybertrucks per week, with a stretch goal of 2,500 vehicles per week by the end of 2024.\nMeta (META)\nMeta stock barely wobbled after news of new regulatory challenges in Europe, as the European Commission circled its wagons to implement new digital markets laws.\nThe Commission said Instagram's \"pay or consent\" advertising model, where users must either consent to personalised ads or pay to remove them, is in breach of its laws.

        "text": "Supermarket Sainsbury\u2019s has notched up a rise in first-quarter sales as solid grocery trading offset a hit from poor early summer weather on its general merchandise and clothing businesses.\nThe chain reported a 3% rise in like-for-like sales, excluding fuel, in the 16 weeks to June 22, stripping out the closure of its Argos business in Ireland.\nTotal grocery sales lifted 4.8% as the firm saw robust growth by volume, although this was the slowest growth seen for many quarters as food inflation has fallen back significantly.\nFigures also out on Tuesday show food inflation is now lower than at any time since 2021, at 2.5% in June, according to the British Retail Consortium (BRC)-NielsenIQ Shop Price Index.\nSainsbury\u2019s revealed that total general merchandise sales fell 4.3% due largely to a blow from unseasonal early summer weather while sales in the Argos business fell 6.2% due to weaker demand for consumer electronics and gaming products.\nThe group said it was sticking to its guidance for underlying retail operating profits of between \u00a31.01 billion and \u00a31.06 billion for the full year, which would be growth of 5% to 10%.\nSimon Roberts, chief executive of Sainsbury\u2019s, said: \u201cWe are pleased with our market-beating grocery performance.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been winning from competitors every month for 15 months, as more and more people are choosing Sainsbury\u2019s for their big weekly shop.\u201d\nMr Roberts said the group was also \u201cgearing up for Wimbledon this week and England\u2019s quarter final match on Saturday night\u201d.\nSophie Lund-Yates, lead equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said the Argos business was an \u201calbatross\u201d around the supermarket\u2019s neck.\nShe said: \u201cAs inflation cools, the weather worsens and tough comparisons crop up on the course, eking out the amount of growth seen last year was always a difficult ask.\n\u201cBut there is a lingering Sainsbury\u2019s specific issue in its ownership of Argos.\n\u201cElectronics aren\u2019t faring well in this economic climate, as people prioritise the essentials.\n\u201cGeneral merchandise is the most cyclical area of the supermarket economy to be in, so being overweight in this arena really slows you down when times get tough.\n\u201cThe additional exposure offsets and hides what has been a remarkable showing for the core grocery business.\u201d",

General merchandise and clothing sales also decreased by 4% and Sainsbury 's Argos retail unit was hit by sluggish demand for consumer electronics, particularly in gaming, the firm said in a statement.\nTotal like-for-like sales growth excluding fuel in the 16 weeks to June 22 eased to 2.7% from 9.8% a year ago. Analysts had anticipated 3.0%, according to a company-compiled consensus forecast cited by UBS.\nHowever, the company backed its forecast for annual retail underying operating profit of 1.01 billion pounds to 1.06 billion pounds, or an increase of 5% to 10% versus the prior year, as well as free cash flow generation of at least 500 million pounds.\nSainsbury's added that it expects to return at least 250 million pounds to shareholders once it has completed the sale of its core banking business to lender NatWest and secured the \"future model\" of its Argos Financial Services division.\nThe UBS analysts said Sainsbury's results presented a \"reassuring\" update on its grocery segment, noting an increase in primary shoppers that is driving higher basket sizes.\nRelated Articles\nSainsbury's says \"tough weather\" has weighed on volumes in recent weeks\nSiemens Energy plans 10,000 new hires as part of grid unit investment - reports\nBofA: Don't sell in May and don't go away",

        "text": "When we invest, we're generally looking for stocks that outperform the market average. And while active stock picking involves risks (and requires diversification) it can also provide excess returns. To wit, the J Sainsbury share price has climbed 38% in five years, easily topping the market return of 0.7% (ignoring dividends). On the other hand, the more recent gains haven't been so impressive, with shareholders gaining just 2.3%, including dividends.\nWith that in mind, it's worth seeing if the company's underlying fundamentals have been the driver of long term performance, or if there are some discrepancies.\nView our latest analysis for J Sainsbury\nTo quote Buffett, 'Ships will sail around the world but the Flat Earth Society will flourish. There will continue to be wide discrepancies between price and value in the marketplace...' One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.\nDuring the five years of share price growth, J Sainsbury moved from a loss to profitability. That would generally be considered a positive, so we'd hope to see the share price to rise.\nThe company's earnings per share (over time) is depicted in the image below (click to see the exact numbers).\nIt might be well worthwhile taking a look at our free report on J Sainsbury's earnings, revenue and cash flow.\nWhat About Dividends?\nAs well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. As it happens, J Sainsbury's TSR for the last 5 years was 77%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!\nA Different Perspective\nJ Sainsbury shareholders gained a total return of 2.3% during the year. But that return falls short of the market. On the bright side, the longer term returns (running at about 12% a year, over half a decade) look better. It may well be that this is a business worth popping on the watching, given the continuing positive reception, over time, from the market. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. Consider risks, for instance. Every company has them, and we've spotted 4 warning signs for J Sainsbury you should know about.",

        "title": "J. Sainsbury (JSAIY) Forms 'Hammer Chart Pattern': Time for Bottom Fishing?",
        "author": "Zacks Equity Research",
        "date": "Wed, 12 Jun 2024 13:55:10 GMT",
        "text": "Shares of J. Sainsbury PLC (JSAIY) have been struggling lately and have lost 7.2% over the past week. However, a hammer chart pattern was formed in its last trading session, which could mean that the stock found support with bulls being able to counteract the bears. So, it could witness a trend reversal down the road.\nWhile the formation of a hammer pattern is a technical indication of nearing a bottom with potential exhaustion of selling pressure, rising optimism among Wall Street analysts about the future earnings of this company is a solid fundamental factor that enhances the prospects of a trend reversal for the stock.\nUnderstanding Hammer Chart and the Technique to Trade It\nThis is one of the popular price patterns in candlestick charting. A minor difference between the opening and closing prices forms a small candle body, and a higher difference between the low of the day and the open or close forms a long lower wick (or vertical line). The length of the lower wick being at least twice the length of the real body, the candle resembles a 'hammer.'\nIn simple terms, during a downtrend, with bears having absolute control, a stock usually opens lower compared to the previous day's close, and again closes lower. On the day the hammer pattern is formed, maintaining the downtrend, the stock makes a new low. However, after eventually finding support at the low of the day, some amount of buying interest emerges, pushing the stock up to close the session near or slightly above its opening price.\nWhen it occurs at the bottom of a downtrend, this pattern signals that the bears might have lost control over the price. And, the success of bulls in stopping the price from falling further indicates a potential trend reversal.\nHammer candles can occur on any timeframe -- such as one-minute, daily, weekly -- and are utilized by both short-term as well as long-term investors.\nLike every technical indicator, the hammer chart pattern has its limitations. Particularly, as the strength of a hammer depends on its placement on the chart, it should always be used in conjunction with other bullish indicators.\nHere's What Makes the Trend Reversal More Likely for JSAIY\nThere has been an upward trend in earnings estimate revisions for JSAIY lately, which can certainly be considered a bullish indicator on the fundamental side. That's because a positive trend in earnings estimate revisions usually translates into price appreciation in the near term.\nOver the last 30 days, the consensus EPS estimate for the current year has increased 2.6%. What it means is that the sell-side analysts covering JSAIY are majorly in agreement that the company will report better earnings than they predicted earlier.",

        "date": "Wed, 12 Jun 2024 11:17:37 GMT",
        "text": "Complaints have been lodged against five major UK supermarket groups over claims they offer freshly baked bread in their stores.\nThe Real Bread Campaign has called the claims made by Tesco, Sainsbury\u2019s, Morrisons, Lidl and The Co-op misleading and has sent complaints to the relevant trading standards authorities.\nReal Bread Campaign, run by the group Sustain, which campaigns for a better system of food, farming and fishing, is unhappy the supermarkets appear to be suggesting bread in their in-store bakeries is baked from scratch from ingredients when instead they are re-baking bread made elsewhere.\nIn a statement sent to Just Food, the Real Bread campaign said: \u201cPeople have a right to know whether a loaf has been made fresh from scratch on-site by a skilled baker, or manufactured elsewhere and merely loaded into a loaf tanning salon.\n\u201cThe truth won\u2019t affect people who shop based on price and availability alone, but it does give everyone else the chance to make better-informed choices about what they buy. Re-baking roughly doubles the energy used, results in products that stale quickly, and so are more likely to lead to food and financial waste and doesn\u2019t support high-quality baking jobs in the store\u2019s local community.\u201d\nIn the case of Sainsbury\u2019s, the campaign group said products in its bakery section use claims including \u201cfreshly made every day\u201d and \u201cfreshly baked bread\u201d.\nReal Bread Campaign said the \u201cclaims are increasingly unrepresentative of the company\u2019s in-store bakeries in general\u201d given Sainsbury\u2019s has announced more of its in-store bakeries would move to a \u201cbake-off model\u201d.\nOn Monday (10 June), the campaign group submitted a complaint against Sainsbury\u2019s to Oxfordshire County Council trading standards.\nIn the case of Tesco, the campaign group said it markets bakery section products using claims including \u201cexpertly baked in store since 1968\u201d, \u201cbaking fresh from our ovens every day\u201d and \u201cfreshly baked throughout the day\u201d on packaging, store displays and its website.\nReal Bread Campaign said it has found that Tesco uses such marketing at stores where no bread is freshly baked from scratch on site.\nChris Young, a co-ordinator at the campaign group, said: \u201cOver a number of years, Tesco has been shutting down in-store bakeries and making skilled baker roles redundant, replacing fresh bread making with staff members loading pre-made products into loaf tanning salons. We\u2019re saddened by the company\u2019s audacity in telling shoppers that things are being expertly, freshly baked and amazed that they\u2019ve been allowed to continue making such claims.\u201d",

        "title": "J Sainsbury (LON:SBRY) Has Some Way To Go To Become A Multi-Bagger",
        "author": "",
        "date": "Fri, 24 May 2024 06:36:19 GMT",
        "text": "If we want to find a stock that could multiply over the long term, what are the underlying trends we should look for? Typically, we'll want to notice a trend of growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and alongside that, an expanding base of capital employed. Ultimately, this demonstrates that it's a business that is reinvesting profits at increasing rates of return. However, after briefly looking over the numbers, we don't think J Sainsbury (LON:SBRY) has the makings of a multi-bagger going forward, but let's have a look at why that may be.\nWhat Is Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)?\nJust to clarify if you're unsure, ROCE is a metric for evaluating how much pre-tax income (in percentage terms) a company earns on the capital invested in its business. To calculate this metric for J Sainsbury, this is the formula:\nReturn on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) \u00f7 (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)\n0.073 = UK\u00a3990m \u00f7 (UK\u00a325b - UK\u00a311b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2024).\nThus, J Sainsbury has an ROCE of 7.3%. Ultimately, that's a low return and it under-performs the Consumer Retailing industry average of 16%.\nSee our latest analysis for J Sainsbury\nIn the above chart we have measured J Sainsbury's prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our free analyst report for J Sainsbury .\nHow Are Returns Trending?\nThere hasn't been much to report for J Sainsbury's returns and its level of capital employed because both metrics have been steady for the past five years. It's not uncommon to see this when looking at a mature and stable business that isn't re-investing its earnings because it has likely passed that phase of the business cycle. So don't be surprised if J Sainsbury doesn't end up being a multi-bagger in a few years time. With fewer investment opportunities, it makes sense that J Sainsbury has been paying out a decent 57% of its earnings to shareholders. Given the business isn't reinvesting in itself, it makes sense to distribute a portion of earnings among shareholders.\nAnother thing to note, J Sainsbury has a high ratio of current liabilities to total assets of 46%. This effectively means that suppliers (or short-term creditors) are funding a large portion of the business, so just be aware that this can introduce some elements of risk. While it's not necessarily a bad thing, it can be beneficial if this ratio is lower.",

        "author": "",
        "date": "Fri, 03 May 2024 05:33:50 GMT",
        "text": "The board of J Sainsbury plc (LON:SBRY) has announced that it will pay a dividend on the 12th of July, with investors receiving \u00a30.092 per share. This makes the dividend yield 5.0%, which will augment investor returns quite nicely.\nCheck out our latest analysis for J Sainsbury\nJ Sainsbury's Payment Has Solid Earnings Coverage\nA big dividend yield for a few years doesn't mean much if it can't be sustained. Based on the last payment, the dividend made up 75% of cash flows, but a higher proportion of net income. The company could be more focused on returning cash to shareholders, but this could indicate that growth opportunities are few and far between.\nLooking forward, earnings per share is forecast to rise exponentially over the next year. If recent patterns in the dividend continue, we could see the payout ratio reaching 51% which is fairly sustainable.\nDividend Volatility\nThe company's dividend history has been marked by instability, with at least one cut in the last 10 years. Since 2014, the dividend has gone from \u00a30.167 total annually to \u00a30.131. The dividend has shrunk at around 2.4% a year during that period. Generally, we don't like to see a dividend that has been declining over time as this can degrade shareholders' returns and indicate that the company may be running into problems.\nDividend Growth Is Doubtful\nWith a relatively unstable dividend, it's even more important to see if earnings per share is growing. J Sainsbury has seen earnings per share falling at 5.2% per year over the last five years. If earnings continue declining, the company may have to make the difficult choice of reducing the dividend or even stopping it completely - the opposite of dividend growth. Earnings are forecast to grow over the next 12 months and if that happens we could still be a little bit cautious until it becomes a pattern.\nThe Dividend Could Prove To Be Unreliable\nOverall, we don't think this company makes a great dividend stock, even though the dividend wasn't cut this year. The track record isn't great, and the payments are a bit high to be considered sustainable. We would be a touch cautious of relying on this stock primarily for the dividend income.\nIt's important to note that companies having a consistent dividend policy will generate greater investor confidence than those having an erratic one. Still, investors need to consider a host of other factors, apart from dividend payments, when analysing a company. For example, we've picked out 3 warning signs for J Sainsbury that investors should know about before committing capital to this stock. Looking for more high-yielding dividend ideas?

However, there were also some disappointing range performances and in the fourth quarter we experienced availability challenges on some core lines, both of which are being addressed in plans for the year ahead.\"\nSainsbury's explained its ambition is to deliver more food choice to more customers as it noted that currently only 15% of its grocery stores carry its full food range.\nTo do this, it plans to bring more of its range to more customers by re-allocating space currently used for general merchandise and clothing to food.\nThe retailer said: \"We will focus on around 180 of our highest potential stores over the next three years.\"\nSainsbury's also shared that its general merchandise and clothing inside its stores will become more aligned to customers\u2019 grocery missions in future in a bid to ensure ranges are \"more relevant and desirable\".\nSimpson-Gould pointed out that while Sainsbury\u2019s outperformed the food and grocery market in 2023 (+8.3%), it continues to struggle in its general merchandise and clothing categories with both sectors failing to provide positive growth past the first quarter.\nShe added: \"The grocer\u2019s Food First strategy, launched in November 2020, has correctly been replaced with the Next Level Sainsbury\u2019s strategy update, which encapsulates a wider focus on retaining momentum in grocery sales and addressing the problem child of its non-food proposition, but will require adept and rapid roll out to provide positive sales momentum to counter declines in food and grocery sales expected in Sainsbury\u2019s first half.\"\nGeneral merchandise (including Argos) declined 0.5%, with Simpson-Gould stating it suffered particularly poor growth in Q4 where sales fell 5.6%.",

        "text": "J. Sainsbury PLC (JSAIY) could be a solid choice for investors given its recent upgrade to a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). This rating change essentially reflects an upward trend in earnings estimates -- one of the most powerful forces impacting stock prices.\nA company's changing earnings picture is at the core of the Zacks rating. The system tracks the Zacks Consensus Estimate -- the consensus measure of EPS estimates from the sell-side analysts covering the stock -- for the current and following years.\nIndividual investors often find it hard to make decisions based on rating upgrades by Wall Street analysts, since these are mostly driven by subjective factors that are hard to see and measure in real time. In these situations, the Zacks rating system comes in handy because of the power of a changing earnings picture in determining near-term stock price movements.\nAs such, the Zacks rating upgrade for J. Sainsbury is essentially a positive comment on its earnings outlook that could have a favorable impact on its stock price.\nMost Powerful Force Impacting Stock Prices\nThe change in a company's future earnings potential, as reflected in earnings estimate revisions, has proven to be strongly correlated with the near-term price movement of its stock. The influence of institutional investors has a partial contribution to this relationship, as these big professionals use earnings and earnings estimates to calculate the fair value of a company's shares. An increase or decrease in earnings estimates in their valuation models simply results in higher or lower fair value for a stock, and institutional investors typically buy or sell it. Their bulk investment action then leads to price movement for the stock.\nFor J. Sainsbury, rising earnings estimates and the consequent rating upgrade fundamentally mean an improvement in the company's underlying business. And investors' appreciation of this improving business trend should push the stock higher.\nHarnessing the Power of Earnings Estimate Revisions\nEmpirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock movements, so it could be truly rewarding if such revisions are tracked for making an investment decision. Here is where the tried-and-tested Zacks Rank stock-rating system plays an important role, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions.\nThe Zacks Rank stock-rating system, which uses four factors related to earnings estimates to classify stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive externally-audited track record, with Zacks Rank #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988.

We will use the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model on this occasion. Don't get put off by the jargon, the math behind it is actually quite straightforward.\nWe would caution that there are many ways of valuing a company and, like the DCF, each technique has advantages and disadvantages in certain scenarios. Anyone interested in learning a bit more about intrinsic value should have a read of the Simply Wall St analysis model.\nSee our latest analysis for J Sainsbury\nThe Calculation\nWe're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.\nA DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:\n10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate\n2024\n2025\n2026\n2027\n2028\n2029\n2030\n2031\n2032\n2033\nLevered FCF (\u00a3, Millions)\nUK\u00a3618.8m\nUK\u00a3554.4m\nUK\u00a3593.0m\nUK\u00a3594.3m\nUK\u00a3664.0m\nUK\u00a3692.8m\nUK\u00a3717.2m\nUK\u00a3738.4m\nUK\u00a3757.4m\nUK\u00a3774.7m\nGrowth Rate Estimate Source\nAnalyst x4\nAnalyst x3\nAnalyst x3\nAnalyst x3\nAnalyst x2\nEst @ 4.33%\nEst @ 3.53%\nEst @ 2.96%\nEst @ 2.56%\nEst @ 2.29%\nPresent Value (\u00a3, Millions) Discounted @ 7.5%\nUK\u00a3575\nUK\u00a3479\nUK\u00a3477\nUK\u00a3444\nUK\u00a3462\nUK\u00a3448\nUK\u00a3431\nUK\u00a3413\nUK\u00a3394\nUK\u00a3375\n(\"Est\" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)\nPresent Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = UK\u00a34.5b\nThe second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (1.6%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 7.5%.",

Our stores are open as usual, accepting chip and pin and cash payments.\n\u2014 Sainsbury's (@sainsburys) March 16, 2024\nIt later said the online ordering system was back up and running and that customers can place orders for delivery from Sunday.\nOne customer said she was meant to have a \u201cvery important\u201d order delivered between 8-9am, which did not happen.\nYvonne, 56, from the Reading area, said: \u201cThe main issue I have with this is the poor communication from Sainsbury\u2019s to its customers.\n\u201cIt was obvious something was wrong at 7am as that\u2019s when they send the receipts normally.\n\u201cCouldn\u2019t get through to anyone about my 8 to 9 delivery.\n\u201cNo statement until about 8.30, only seemed to be on social media which not all customers will have.\n\u201cShould have been an email or text to customers which would have helped those like myself expecting an early morning delivery. Much to improve on with their communications.\u201d\nArgos, which is owned by Sainsbury\u2019s, has also been affected by the software update, meaning some customers may have had issues ordering new items or collecting orders in-store.\nIt said there may have been delays in fulfilling orders placed.\nOnly a small proportion of Tesco orders due for delivery on Saturday were impacted, it is understood.",

Nevertheless, we are always paying attention to the latest value, growth, and momentum trends to underscore strong picks.\nOf these, perhaps no stock market trend is more popular than value investing, which is a strategy that has proven to be successful in all sorts of market environments. Value investors use tried-and-true metrics and fundamental analysis to find companies that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels.\nLuckily, Zacks has developed its own Style Scores system in an effort to find stocks with specific traits. Value investors will be interested in the system's \"Value\" category. Stocks with both \"A\" grades in the Value category and high Zacks Ranks are among the strongest value stocks on the market right now.\nOne stock to keep an eye on is J. Sainsbury (JSAIY). JSAIY is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy), as well as a Value grade of A. The stock is trading with P/E ratio of 12.03 right now. For comparison, its industry sports an average P/E of 20.35. JSAIY's Forward P/E has been as high as 15.95 and as low as 11.05, with a median of 13.40, all within the past year.\nWe should also highlight that JSAIY has a P/B ratio of 0.84. The P/B is a method of comparing a stock's market value to its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. This stock's P/B looks attractive against its industry's average P/B of 1.74. Within the past 52 weeks, JSAIY's P/B has been as high as 1.03 and as low as 0.76, with a median of 0.92.\nThese figures are just a handful of the metrics value investors tend to look at, but they help show that J. Sainsbury is likely being undervalued right now.

        "text": "In this article:\nJSAIY\nKey Insights\nGiven the large stake in the stock by institutions, J Sainsbury's stock price might be vulnerable to their trading decisions\nA total of 12 investors have a majority stake in the company with 50% ownership\nOwnership research along with analyst forecasts data help provide a good understanding of opportunities in a stock\nEvery investor in J Sainsbury plc (LON:SBRY) should be aware of the most powerful shareholder groups. We can see that institutions own the lion's share in the company with 44% ownership. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).\nGiven the vast amount of money and research capacities at their disposal, institutional ownership tends to carry a lot of weight, especially with individual investors. Therefore, a good portion of institutional money invested in the company is usually a huge vote of confidence on its future.\nLet's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about J Sainsbury.\nCheck out our latest analysis for J Sainsbury\nWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About J Sainsbury?\nInstitutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.\nAs you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in J Sainsbury. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at J Sainsbury's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.\nHedge funds don't have many shares in J Sainsbury. Qatar Holding LLC is currently the company's largest shareholder with 14% of shares outstanding. With 10% and 6.2% of the shares outstanding respectively, Vesa Equity Investment S.\u00e0 R.L. and Pzena Investment Management, Inc. are the second and third largest shareholders.\nLooking at the shareholder registry, we can see that 50% of the ownership is controlled by the top 12 shareholders, meaning that no single shareholder has a majority interest in the ownership.\nWhile studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.",

        "text": "Investors interested in stocks from the Retail - Supermarkets sector have probably already heard of J. Sainsbury PLC (JSAIY) and Wal-Mart de Mexico SAB de CV (WMMVY). But which of these two stocks offers value investors a better bang for their buck right now? We'll need to take a closer look.\nThe best way to find great value stocks is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system. The proven Zacks Rank emphasizes companies with positive estimate revision trends, and our Style Scores highlight stocks with specific traits.\nJ. Sainsbury PLC has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), while Wal-Mart de Mexico SAB de CV has a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold) right now. This system places an emphasis on companies that have seen positive earnings estimate revisions, so investors should feel comfortable knowing that JSAIY is likely seeing its earnings outlook improve to a greater extent. But this is just one piece of the puzzle for value investors.\nValue investors also try to analyze a wide range of traditional figures and metrics to help determine whether a company is undervalued at its current share price levels.\nOur Value category highlights undervalued companies by looking at a variety of key metrics, including the popular P/E ratio, as well as the P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a variety of other fundamentals that have been used by value investors for years.\nJSAIY currently has a forward P/E ratio of 13.15, while WMMVY has a forward P/E of 22.75. We also note that JSAIY has a PEG ratio of 0.39. This popular figure is similar to the widely-used P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also considers a company's expected EPS growth rate. WMMVY currently has a PEG ratio of 2.77.\nAnother notable valuation metric for JSAIY is its P/B ratio of 0.85. The P/B ratio is used to compare a stock's market value with its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. For comparison, WMMVY has a P/B of 7.28.\nBased on these metrics and many more, JSAIY holds a Value grade of A, while WMMVY has a Value grade of C.\nJSAIY has seen stronger estimate revision activity and sports more attractive valuation metrics than WMMVY, so it seems like value investors will conclude that JSAIY is the superior option right now.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Our reporter Adam Mawardi has the details:\nLondon could lose control of its lucrative clearing market after EU officials backed proposals to shift more business activity to operators across the bloc.\nThe provisional rules require banks and asset managers above a certain threshold to clear derivative contracts, such as euro interest rate swaps, through accounts with EU-based clearing houses.\nVincent Van Peteghem, Belgium\u2019s finance minister who helped negotiate the agreement with the European Parliament, said: \u201cThis will bring more clearing services to Europe and enhance our strategic autonomy.\u201d\nClearing houses serve as middlemen between buyers and sellers for financial assets and ensure deals go through even when counterparties default.\nThey have become a crucial part of the banking system following the 2008 financial crisis which exposed the risks around derivative trading.\nThe controversial change is designed to make EU clearing houses more attractive, effectively ending Europe\u2019s reliance on UK-based rivals following Brexit.",

While I\u2019m proud of the progress we\u2019ve made to date, we\u2019re only just at the beginning of rediscovering quite what this business is capable of.\u201d\nFresh cost-cutting measures will include more robotic automation in its warehouses for general merchandise, having fewer but bigger depots and reducing the number of deliveries into stores.\nIt will also open around 75 new Sainsbury\u2019s local convenience stores over the next three years, where more space will be dedicated to so-called \u201cfood on the move\u201d, including sandwiches and ready meals.\nThe retailer vowed to deliver better returns for shareholders, committing to a progressive dividend policy from the start of the next financial year.\nIt said it would also start a share buyback programme, paying out \u00a3200m over the next financial year.\nMr Roberts said: \u201cBy taking Sainsbury\u2019s to the next level, delivering for customers and colleagues, we will also deliver enhanced returns for shareholders through a share buyback and committing to a progressive dividend.\u201d",

A boost to food and drink sales was cancelled out by falling sales of electronics and clothing, triggering a 5pc drop in the supermarket\u2019s share price.\nArgos was blamed for the weak electronics sales as customers cut back on expensive items such as TVs. Purchases at the retailer fell by 4.2pc in the six weeks to January 6.\nElsewhere, grocery sales at the supermarket giant rose by 8.6pc, supported by record sales of sparkling wine, mince pies and pigs in blankets over Christmas. Sales of Taste the Difference products jumped by 13pc over the festive period.\nSainsbury\u2019s, the UK\u2019s second-largest supermarket, increased its market share from 15.6pc to 15.8pc in December, according to the most recent Kantar data.\nThe grocer, along with other traditional supermarkets, has been locked in a battle with discounters Aldi and Lidl after the German discounters gained momentum during the cost of living crisis.",

        "author": "",
        "date": "Thu, 21 Dec 2023 05:54:36 GMT",
        "text": "In this article:\nJSAIY\nMost readers would already be aware that J Sainsbury's (LON:SBRY) stock increased significantly by 14% over the past month. Given that stock prices are usually aligned with a company's financial performance in the long-term, we decided to study its financial indicators more closely to see if they had a hand to play in the recent price move. In this article, we decided to focus on J Sainsbury's ROE.\nReturn on Equity or ROE is a test of how effectively a company is growing its value and managing investors\u2019 money. In simpler terms, it measures the profitability of a company in relation to shareholder's equity.\nView our latest analysis for J Sainsbury\nHow Is ROE Calculated?\nThe formula for return on equity is:\nReturn on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) \u00f7 Shareholders' Equity\nSo, based on the above formula, the ROE for J Sainsbury is:\n1.1% = UK\u00a377m \u00f7 UK\u00a37.2b (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2023).\nThe 'return' is the profit over the last twelve months. One way to conceptualize this is that for each \u00a31 of shareholders' capital it has, the company made \u00a30.01 in profit.\nWhat Is The Relationship Between ROE And Earnings Growth?\nWe have already established that ROE serves as an efficient profit-generating gauge for a company's future earnings. Based on how much of its profits the company chooses to reinvest or \"retain\", we are then able to evaluate a company's future ability to generate profits. Assuming everything else remains unchanged, the higher the ROE and profit retention, the higher the growth rate of a company compared to companies that don't necessarily bear these characteristics.\nJ Sainsbury's Earnings Growth And 1.1% ROE\nIt is hard to argue that J Sainsbury's ROE is much good in and of itself. Not just that, even compared to the industry average of 14%, the company's ROE is entirely unremarkable. However, we we're pleasantly surprised to see that J Sainsbury grew its net income at a significant rate of 24% in the last five years. We reckon that there could be other factors at play here. For instance, the company has a low payout ratio or is being managed efficiently.\nNext, on comparing with the industry net income growth, we found that J Sainsbury's growth is quite high when compared to the industry average growth of 19% in the same period, which is great to see.\nThe basis for attaching value to a company is, to a great extent, tied to its earnings growth. The investor should try to establish if the expected growth or decline in earnings, whichever the case may be, is priced in. This then helps them determine if the stock is placed for a bright or bleak future. Is SBRY fairly valued? This infographic on the company's intrinsic value has everything you need to know.",

For some grocers, it's a chance to upsell to consumers that can afford to splash out during the holidays.\n\"The trend on groceries is strong,\" Simon Roberts, CEO of Sainsbury's, Britain's second biggest grocer, told Reuters last month. \"We're set for a strong food Christmas.\"\nSainsbury's has broadened its own-brand \"Taste the Difference\" premium food range, adding 170 new Christmas food products including a ready meal for four of duck, potatoes and cranberry sauce for 28 pounds ($36), and canap\u00e9s like mini smoked salmon terrine slices for 3.75 pounds.\nBritons expect to spend around 105 pounds more on Christmas this year than in 2022, according to Barclays research, with festive food and drink expected to be the largest contributor - rising by an average of almost 26 pounds.\nUK market leader Tesco has bought more turkeys than last year, CEO Ken Murphy said, as it expects people will go out less and spend more time at home with friends and family.\n\"I am doing a lot of hosting in the next couple of weeks, and we do prefer to do stuff at home - it's just more relaxing,\" said Robyn Asher, 55, as she shopped in a Sainsbury's supermarket in East Dulwich, London.\n\"You can drink much nicer wine at home, because the mark-up is way too much in restaurants,\" she added. In her trolley were five bottles of wine and one of champagne for her family's Christmas celebrations, to take advantage of the supermarket's offer of 25% off for six bottles.\nJames Simpson, managing director of champagne producer Pol Roger, said although champagne sales growth will likely slow overall in 2023, he anticipated strong sales over Christmas when even thrifty consumers tend to splash out and treat themselves.\nBritons have bought 3.9 million litres of champagne this year, down 9% from last year, according to Kantar data on the 52 weeks ending Nov 26.\nIn France, shoppers aim to cut their overall Christmas spending this year, with the average budget down by 19 euros compared to 2022 according to a survey by Cofidis and CSA Research. They aim to cut their spending the most on gifts.\nSupermarket chain Carrefour is trying to attract shoppers with low prices like a 0.99 euro ($1.09) chocolate advent calendar, among 60 new own-brand Christmas food products the retailer has introduced this year.",

There\u2019s been this return to the office and, especially around Christmas, we\u2019re all short of time.\u201d\nCustomers are \u201cbusy trying to manage a family, get to work, get the kids from school, get back in time,\u201d he added.\nSainsbury\u2019s larger range compared to German discounters has become an attractive selling point in this context.\nFor example, Aldi stocks just a twentieth of the number of products as Sainsbury\u2019s, at 2,000 compared to 40,000.\nMr Roberts, who joined Sainsbury\u2019s in 2017 and took over as chief executive in 2020, told The Telegraph: \u201cWe\u2019re seeing customers doing trolleys with more products in more regularly. That\u2019s quite a shift from where we were three years ago.\u201d\nBritain\u2019s second largest grocer last month recorded its biggest increase in shopper numbers in a decade. Sainsbury\u2019s increased its share of the grocery market to 15.6pc at the end of November, up from 15.2pc the prior month. At the same time, Aldi\u2019s market share slipped to 9.6pc from 9.7pc, according to data provider Kantar.\nMr Roberts said his supermarket had also been helped by its Aldi price match scheme, which guarantees customers the same price on 500 products.\nSigns that Sainsbury\u2019s is successfully staging a fightback against the discounters might come as a surprise to some, as cost of living pressures continue to weigh on shoppers.\nOn the face of things, Sainsbury\u2019s is far from the cheapest supermarket. Figures from Which? suggest that only Waitrose costs more when it comes to a typical shopping trolley.\nMr Roberts questioned the methodology of much of the research in the market. Sainsbury\u2019s overhauled its Nectar loyalty card scheme earlier this year, switching it from a points-based system that allowed people to build up discounts, to a membership that entitled people to cheaper prices at the tills. The overhaul made the programme more similar to Tesco\u2019s Clubcard scheme.\nThe prices used in the Which? surveys are not the ones offered to its Nectar loyalty card scheme. Mr Roberts said it is not right \u201cto look at this through the lens of, what about the people that don\u2019t spend with Nectar prices? Because, the vast majority do \u2013 they can see the value\u201d.",

        "text": "The European Commission is set to recommend postponing a controversial tariff on electric cars traded between the UK and Europe by three years, according to a Bloomberg report.\nCar manufacturers on both sides of the English Channel have been lobbying the Commission to delay the tariffs, which they argue would only help manufacturers in Asia, who dominate the market for battery manufacturing. China reportedly has 125 gigafactories - a term popularised by Tesla for electric vehicle battery plants - while the UK currently has none.\nUnder the current post-Brexit arrangements, from January 1 electric vehicles moving between Britain and the EU would attract a 10pc duty if less than 45pc of the value of the vehicles comes from the UK or Europe. This so-called \u201crule of origin\u201d is designed to encourage a domestic supply chain.\nBut attempts to develop domestic battery production have been slow, with Britishvolt, which is attempting to build a gigafactory at Blyth in northeast England, falling into administration in January. More promisingly, Jaguar Land Rover is to build a \u00a34bn battery factory in Somerset, but this will not be finished until 2026.\nThe European Commission\u2019s recommendation will need to be approved by member states, and by the British Government.\nRead the latest updates below.\n06:31 PM GMT\nSigning off\nThanks for joining us today.

Just $108bn of mergers and acquisitions (M&A) have been struck so far in 2023, down from $208bn last year.\nThe January to November total is the lowest for a decade. Separate official figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) also show a steady decline in UK cross-border dealmaking.\nSome 362 British businesses were involved in deals worth over \u00a31m between July and September, down from 470 in the three months to June.\nDealmaking has collapsed because of rising interest rates, which make it more expensive to finance takeovers, and investor unease towards the UK.\nPart of the problem is the smaller number of blockbuster acquisitions. Only two takeovers - EQT\u2019s \u00a34.5bn takeover of veterinary medicine business Dechra Pharmaceuticals and Danaher\u2019s $5.7bn takeover of biotech business Abcam - can be deemed major deals.\nThe takeover drought is a blow for City bankers, lawyers and other advisors who work on deals.\nSeveral professional services companies, including Barclays and PwC, have announced job cuts in recent months.\nThe slump in deal making reflects a global downturn, with worldwide mergers and acquisitions (M&A) also reaching a decade-long low according to LSEG.\nWhile the downturn in dealmaking is global, economists have warned of a \u201cdoom-loop\u201d in UK equities as falling values and the sluggish London market make the stock exchange unattractive to new listings and investors.",

        "title": "The 3.0% return this week takes J Sainsbury's (LON:SBRY) shareholders three-year gains to 56%",
        "author": "",
        "date": "Mon, 04 Dec 2023 11:33:48 GMT",
        "text": "One simple way to benefit from the stock market is to buy an index fund. But if you pick the right individual stocks, you could make more than that. Just take a look at J Sainsbury plc (LON:SBRY), which is up 34%, over three years, soundly beating the market return of 0.2% (not including dividends). On the other hand, the returns haven't been quite so good recently, with shareholders up just 33% , including dividends .\nAfter a strong gain in the past week, it's worth seeing if longer term returns have been driven by improving fundamentals.\nView our latest analysis for J Sainsbury\nTo paraphrase Benjamin Graham: Over the short term the market is a voting machine, but over the long term it's a weighing machine. By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.\nJ Sainsbury became profitable within the last three years. That would generally be considered a positive, so we'd expect the share price to be up.\nYou can see below how EPS has changed over time (discover the exact values by clicking on the image).\nIt is of course excellent to see how J Sainsbury has grown profits over the years, but the future is more important for shareholders. If you are thinking of buying or selling J Sainsbury stock, you should check out this FREE detailed report on its balance sheet.\nWhat About Dividends?\nAs well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. As it happens, J Sainsbury's TSR for the last 3 years was 56%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return.\nA Different Perspective\nIt's good to see that J Sainsbury has rewarded shareholders with a total shareholder return of 33% in the last twelve months. That's including the dividend. Since the one-year TSR is better than the five-year TSR (the latter coming in at 5% per year), it would seem that the stock's performance has improved in recent times. Given the share price momentum remains strong, it might be worth taking a closer look at the stock, lest you miss an opportunity. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand J Sainsbury better, we need to consider many other factors. Take risks, for example - J Sainsbury has 3 warning signs (and 1 which makes us a bit uncomfortable) we think you should know about.",

        "author": "",
        "date": "Mon, 20 Nov 2023 10:05:17 GMT",
        "text": "Did you know there are some financial metrics that can provide clues of a potential multi-bagger? In a perfect world, we'd like to see a company investing more capital into its business and ideally the returns earned from that capital are also increasing. Ultimately, this demonstrates that it's a business that is reinvesting profits at increasing rates of return. Having said that, from a first glance at J Sainsbury (LON:SBRY) we aren't jumping out of our chairs at how returns are trending, but let's have a deeper look.\nWhat Is Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)?\nFor those that aren't sure what ROCE is, it measures the amount of pre-tax profits a company can generate from the capital employed in its business. To calculate this metric for J Sainsbury, this is the formula:\nReturn on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) \u00f7 (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)\n0.07 = UK\u00a31.0b \u00f7 (UK\u00a326b - UK\u00a312b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2023).\nThus, J Sainsbury has an ROCE of 7.0%. Ultimately, that's a low return and it under-performs the Consumer Retailing industry average of 14%.\nSee our latest analysis for J Sainsbury\nIn the above chart we have measured J Sainsbury's prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our free report for J Sainsbury.\nWhat The Trend Of ROCE Can Tell Us\nThere are better returns on capital out there than what we're seeing at J Sainsbury. The company has employed 23% more capital in the last five years, and the returns on that capital have remained stable at 7.0%. This poor ROCE doesn't inspire confidence right now, and with the increase in capital employed, it's evident that the business isn't deploying the funds into high return investments.\nOn a side note, J Sainsbury's current liabilities are still rather high at 44% of total assets. This can bring about some risks because the company is basically operating with a rather large reliance on its suppliers or other sorts of short-term creditors. While it's not necessarily a bad thing, it can be beneficial if this ratio is lower.\nThe Bottom Line On J Sainsbury's ROCE\nLong story short, while J Sainsbury has been reinvesting its capital, the returns that it's generating haven't increased. And with the stock having returned a mere 10.0% in the last five years to shareholders, you could argue that they're aware of these lackluster trends. So if you're looking for a multi-bagger, the underlying trends indicate you may have better chances elsewhere.",

However, this was offset by weaker sales in its clothes division and the Tu brand.\nSales in Argos were up 3.3pc after it bulked up the range of products sold.\nOverall revenues were up 3.5pc, excluding VAT but including fuel.",

Asda was found to have the cheapest trolley at \u00a3325.71, followed by Morrisons with \u00a3332.22.\nIt comes as Waitrose cut its prices for a third time this year last month, lowering costs on 250 popular autumn products including steak pies, porridge and maris piper potatoes.\nThe monthly analysis included special offers available to all shoppers but not loyalty discounts, including Sainsbury\u2019s \u201cNectar Price\u201d discounts.\nIt has led to Sainsbury\u2019s strongly disputing the results.\nA Sainsbury\u2019s spokesman said: \u201cThese claims are entirely false and insulting to the millions of savvy customers who choose to shop with us every week. There is an overwhelming amount of independently verified data showing the great value customers get when shopping at Sainsbury\u2019s.\n\u201cWe are disappointed that Which? has refused to share its data with us and has instead chosen to mislead customers by choosing to exclude Nectar Prices promotions in its research.\n\u201cThe vast majority of our customers are shopping with Nectar Prices and have saved \u00a3400m on their shopping in the last six months. Customers can be sure they are getting great value every time they shop with us.\u201d\nIn separate mystery shopping surveys conducted by the Grocer magazine, Sainsbury\u2019s has ranked as the cheapest supermarket due to its Nectar Price discounts.\nEle Clark, of Which?, said: \u201cAs millions struggle with increased food prices and other high household bills, it is no surprise that many are turning to discounters for their food shop. Our latest research shows that once again Aldi is the cheapest supermarket for a basket of groceries but for the first time, Sainsbury\u2019s has come out as the most expensive for a big shop.\u201d\nMeanwhile, Waitrose has reintroduced daily free coffees for myWaitrose members and began selling lunchtime meal deals for the first time in September in a bid to help customers save.\nA Waitrose spokesman said: \u201cAs part of our \u00a3100m investment we\u2019ve already lowered hundreds of prices this year, and it\u2019s great to see this paying off.",

        "text": "Key Insights\nGiven the large stake in the stock by institutions, J Sainsbury's stock price might be vulnerable to their trading decisions\n52% of the business is held by the top 9 shareholders\nInsiders have been buying lately\nIf you want to know who really controls J Sainsbury plc (LON:SBRY), then you'll have to look at the makeup of its share registry. We can see that institutions own the lion's share in the company with 52% ownership. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.\nSince institutional have access to huge amounts of capital, their market moves tend to receive a lot of scrutiny by retail or individual investors. Therefore, a good portion of institutional money invested in the company is usually a huge vote of confidence on its future.\nLet's delve deeper into each type of owner of J Sainsbury, beginning with the chart below.\nView our latest analysis for J Sainsbury\nWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About J Sainsbury?\nMany institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.\nWe can see that J Sainsbury does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see J Sainsbury's historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.\nInstitutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in J Sainsbury. Qatar Holding LLC is currently the largest shareholder, with 14% of shares outstanding. With 10% and 6.7% of the shares outstanding respectively, Vesa Equity Investment S.\u00e0 R.L. and Pzena Investment Management, Inc. are the second and third largest shareholders.\nWe did some more digging and found that 9 of the top shareholders account for roughly 52% of the register, implying that along with larger shareholders, there are a few smaller shareholders, thereby balancing out each others interests somewhat.",

This includes devices like smart speakers, security cameras, and even washing machines.\nSmart speakers, like those from Bose, were found to share user data with Meta, the parent company of Facebook, according to Which?. The amount of data requested by smart speakers varied depending on whether the user had an Android or iOS device. Google (GOOGL) Nest products, for example, requested contacts and location on Android but not on Apple's (AAPL) iOS.\n\u201cFirms should not collect more data than they need to provide the service that\u2019s on offer, particularly if they are going to bury this important information in lengthy terms and conditions,\u201d said Rocio Concha, Which? director of policy and advocacy.\nThe research suggests that, despite consumers having already paid up to thousands of pounds for smart products, they are also having to \u2018pay\u2019 with their personal data.\nSmart cameras and doorbells\nWhen it comes to smart cameras and doorbells, Which? discovered that Ezviz devices, sold by major retailers like Argos (SBRY.L), had numerous tracking firms active, including TikTok's business marketing unit, Pangle, Huawei, Google, and Meta (META).\nGoogle's Nest product require users' full name, email, date of birth, and gender.\nIn 2021 a judge ruled security cameras and a ring doorbell installed in a house in Oxfordshire \"unjustifiably invaded\" the privacy of a neighbour that broke data laws and contributed to harassment.\nRead more: AI hyper-personalisation and regulation anxiety come into focus at London Tech Week\nSmart washing machines also raised concerns as they required the customer's name, date of birth, email, phone contacts, precise location, and phone number.

        "text": "The Bank of England has been accused of making a \u201cpolitical decision\u201d after holding interest rates at a 16-year high despite inflation falling to its target.\nConservative MPs accused officials on the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of being unfairly and unduly swayed by the upcoming election.\nRishi Sunak\u2019s last hope of a cut to borrowing costs before the general election was dashed on Thursday after the MPC voted to keep interest rates at 5.25pc.\nThe decision to maintain borrowing costs at the same level for the seventh consecutive meeting came despite inflation falling back to the Bank\u2019s 2pc target this week.\nSir Jacob Rees-Mogg, a former business secretary, said: \u201cIt is a political decision by the Bank of England. Inflation is now on target and rates need to be cut.\n\u201cThat we are in an election period ought to make no difference but the Bank has made a decision based on short-term politics rather than economics.\u201d\nThe minutes of the MPC\u2019s latest meeting said the election \u201cwas not relevant\u201d to the decision to hold interest rates unchanged.\n\u201cThe committee noted that the timing of the general election on 4 July was not relevant to its decision at this meeting, which would as usual be made on the basis of what was judged necessary to achieve the 2pc inflation target sustainably in the medium term,\u201d the minutes said.\nHowever, Bob Blackman, a senior Conservative standing for re-election, said: \u201cYou\u2019ve got to ask the question why they are not cutting. They have got to justify the decision not to cut interest rates.\u201d\nDanny Kruger, a Conservative MP and former member of the Treasury select committee, said the Bank had held rates too high for too long. He said: \u201cRates should have come down at the last meeting and it\u2019s a great shame the MPC are holding off yet again.\n\u201cInflation is now back to target and businesses and mortgage holders badly need a rate cut to get the economy growing again.\u201d\nAndrew Bailey, the Bank\u2019s Governor, said borrowing costs needed to stay higher for longer to squeeze lingering price pressures out of the economy. While headline inflation has fallen back to target, prices in the dominant services sector are still rising faster than officials would like.\nMr Bailey said: \u201cIt\u2019s good news that inflation has returned to our 2pc target. We need to be sure that inflation will stay low and that\u2019s why we\u2019ve decided to hold rates at 5.25pc for now.\u201d\nThe Bank\u2019s decision also faced criticism from the Left. George Dibb, an economist at the Left-leaning think tank the Institute for Public Policy Research, said high rates were holding back the economy.",

As many health & beauty items are low value, essential purchases with quick replacement cycles, discounters have been able to drive greater volumes and increase their penetration in the sector.\nWith 2018 set to be another challenging year for retailers as consumers\u2019 disposable income remains restricted, discounters and general merchandisers will continue to appeal to shoppers and therefore gain further share in health & beauty. To retain their market shares, Tesco, Sainsbury\u2019s, ASDA and Morrisons must ensure that their prices and offers are more competitive both online and instore, also leveraging their loyalty schemes where available to keep shoppers from switching to discounters.\nAt the other end of the sector, upper midmarket and premium cosmetic brands such as MAC, Charlotte Tilbury and Fenty Beauty are encouraging younger shoppers to trade up from cheaper drugstore brands such as L\u2019Or\u00e9al. With greater awareness and interest in cult products driven by bloggers and celebrities on social media, millennials are increasingly buying into more premium brands. This is drawing spend away from the likes of Boots and grocers to department stores, brands\u2019 own channels and online pureplays like ASOS, Amazon, Lookfantastic and Feelunique.\nWhile midmarket department stores such as House of Fraser and Debenhams have recently struggled to halt sales declines within clothing & footwear, they have continued to focus on health & beauty to drive sales. Both midmarket and premium department stores such as Selfridges and Harvey Nichols have secured brand and product exclusives or have introduced brands with limited availability \u2013 such as Hourglass, Charlotte Tilbury, Fenty Beauty and The Ordinary \u2013 and will continue to benefit from increased footfall as a result of this.\nBoots, which announced yesterday that it had seen a 3.3% fall in its like-for-like retail sales in the three months to 28th February 2018, must invest in its branded offer, ensuring this is up-to-date and relevant, as competitor Superdrug continues to do. As Glossier only has an online presence in the UK, it is an emergent brand which Boots could stock within its stores and online to attract younger shoppers. Glossier has more accessible price points compared to more premium and designer brands such as Clinique, Dior and Chanel and the brand would encourage younger customers to trade up from the likes of Rimmel and NYX, and support Boots\u2019 future growth within skincare and cosmetics \u2013 two of the fastest growing categories out to 2023.",

(Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Alan Katz, Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you, sir. You may begin.\nAlan Katz\nGood morning and thank you for joining our first quarter 2024 earnings conference call. This morning, we issued our earnings release reporting financials for the quarter ended March 31, 2024. A copy of the earnings release and the presentation that we will reference during this call are available on the Investor Relations section of our website, which can be found at www.ncrvoyix.com and have been filed with the SEC.\nWith me on the call today are David Wilkinson, our Chief Executive Officer; and Brian Webb-Walsh, our Chief Financial Officer. This call is being recorded and the webcast is available on the Investor Relations section of our website. Before we begin, please be advised that remarks today will contain forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and other factors, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. For additional information on these factors, please refer to our earnings release and our other reports filed with the SEC. We caution you not to place undue reliance on these statements. Forward-looking statements during this call speak only as of the date of this call and we undertake no obligation to update them.\nIn addition, we will be discussing or providing certain non-GAAP financial measures today, which we believe are more reflective of our ongoing performance. For a full reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures discussed in this call to the most comparable GAAP measure in accordance with SEC regulations, please see our press release furnished as an exhibit to our Form 8-K filed this morning and our supplemental materials available on the Investor Relations section of our website.\nWith that, I would like to now turn the call over to David.\nDavid Wilkinson\nThank you, Alan and welcome, everyone, to our first quarter 2024 earnings call. For the quarter, we delivered revenue and adjusted EBITDA in line with expectations. Normalized software and services revenue grew 5% and as we continue to onboard new and existing customers to our commerce and digital banking platforms. We executed on our transformation initiatives and saw the impact of continued growth within our higher-margin revenue streams.\nWe achieved solid sales results across our segments, including signing nearly 300 new customers and expanding with existing customers. I'll provide more detail on our sales activity in our segment updates. We also continued converting customers to our platform and now have a total of approximately 61,000 retail and restaurant platform sites, approximately 18% of our total customer sites. The ongoing execution of our platform strategy, coupled with our increased investments in our global sales and services network drove total segment ARR growth of 5% and software ARR growth of 6%.\nLet's turn to our restaurants segment slide on Slide 6. In the first quarter, we signed more than 230 new customers and increased our platform and payment sites by 6% and 26%, respectively. Segment ARR grew 5% in the first quarter. In our enterprise business, we announced a new multiyear agreement with Prest, one of the leading fresh juice brands in the U.S. with more than 100 locations and a growing e-commerce and wholesale business. Under our agreement, we will provide a full suite of solutions, including point-of-sale, back office, e-commerce, loyalty and payments, which simplifies their operations and reporting across their physical and digital channels. Further, our integrated consumer marketing solution will run the Prest loyalty and marketing program, both in stores and online. Prest moved from a smaller provider to our platform allowing them to engage with their end users and improve the guest experience while also driving efficiencies for their organization.\nIn addition to signing new customers, we renewed and expanded with our existing restaurant customers this quarter including a leading restaurant conglomerate in the U.S., who has been an NCR Voyix customer for more than 20 years. This customer has increasingly utilized our commerce platform across their footprint of approximately 600 restaurants to improve their digital guest experience and increase customer satisfaction.\nIn 2023, we began providing real-time data and menu cataloging for this customer. In Q1 of this year, we further expanded our agreement to enable this customer to better serve their patrons ordering outside of the restaurant and deliver an experience that matches their brand promise of exceeding guest expectations. We're seeing traction in our mid-market growth efforts, signing new logos and expanding with existing customers. We continue to execute against our payments led strategy for new mid-market customers, demonstrated by our 90-plus percent attach rate this quarter. We are growing our sales team, simplifying the sales and onboarding process and improving our pricing and packaging, which will accelerate growth for this business.\nLet's move on to our Retail segment on Slide 7. This quarter, we signed more than 50 new small and mid-market customers and 4 enterprise customers, leading to more than 800 additional sites. We also increased our platform sites by nearly 57% as we continue to convert on-premise customers and onboard newly signed customers to our commerce platform.\nSegment ARR grew 5% and software ARR grew 10% attributed to the powerful impact of attaching to the platform. One example of this is a multiyear expansion and renewal we signed with Sainsbury's, one of the largest grocery chains in the U.K. with over 1,700 store locations. For more than 2 decades, we have provided Sainsbury's with our on-premise point-of-sale software solution and self-checkout technology with related services.\nLast month, Sainsbury's implemented our data and analytics module as part of their expanded agreement. We're on track to connect their entire store footprint, which operates more than 22,000 lanes to our commerce platform. As part of the contract in 2025, we will upgrade their point-of-sale and self-checkout software to our cloud-based and in-lane solutions.\nSainsbury's commitment to our cloud-native platform solution will drive a payback on their investment in less than 2 years and drive incremental recurring revenue and adjusted EBITDA for our business over the life of the contract. We're excited to continue our strategic partnership to eliminate in-store complexity and deliver an enhanced guest experience.\nWhile platform conversions with enterprise customers often have longer sales cycles and take time to deploy, once implemented, they are accretive to revenue and margin and create a return on investment for our customers. Sainsbury's is a great example of how a customer can realize a fast payback on its investment when converting to the platform.\nOur retail customers are increasingly focused on providing choice as part of their guest experience, which is accelerating interest for our next-generation, self-checkout solution. For example, this quarter, we expanded our self-checkout contract with a leading global e-commerce retailer that I highlighted on our last call. We weren't even finished with the initial rollout when this customer doubled the number of self-checkout sites and contracted to implement our next-gen solution for the remaining installations.\nWe also expanded our relationship with the Navy Exchange, an existing point-of-sale customer and will now be deploying self-checkout across 40 of their stores throughout the U.S. with the potential to expand to additional stores over time. We were able to expedite this expansion as a direct result of a recommendation from another government customer, the Army and Air Force Exchange, based on their experience as an NCR Voyix self-checkout, technology and services customer.\nLet's move on to Slide 8. Our Digital Banking segment demonstrated strong financial and operational performance this quarter. Our registered users grew 5% to more than 28.5 million and the number of active users grew 3% to more than 19.7 million, while segment ARR increased 7%.\nIn 2024, we have taken steps to now align the organizational structure and operating model of our digital banking business with our growth strategy. We've built out our senior leadership team and have consolidated our 4 business lines into a single organization, streamlining our operations and simplifying our go-to market. Although our realignment is in its early stages, we have already been able to drive greater sales activity and are realizing cost efficiencies. Further, we have reduced our capital investment without sacrificing research and development capacity, product innovation or speed to market in our platform, products and solutions.\nIn the first quarter, we expanded our relationships with over 200 existing customers selling additional products and solutions. We continue to unlock ARPU and ARR growth in the largest customer base in the digital banking industry. One notable expansion was with a Tier 1 retail bank that will now use our platform to serve an additional portion of their customer base and further increase cost efficiencies for their business. Today, 13 of the 15 largest retail banks in the U.S. utilize our digital-first platform.\nIn addition to expanding our existing relationships, we also signed 5 new financial institutions this quarter, further expanding our industry-leading client roster. For example, we signed a contract with Apple Bank, the largest state-chartered savings bank in New York, with over 80 branches and $17 billion of assets under management. Apple Bank selected us given the strong value proposition of our comprehensive digital-first platform, our differentiated end user experience and the potential to drive efficiencies, leveraging our technology. I would now like to provide an update on our platform offerings. As we continue to invest in and improve our products and services, we will aim to strengthen our customer relationships and capture additional market share, beginning with NCR Voyix Loyalty, our proprietary integrated customer marketing solution that allows better personalization and drives incremental revenue by combining customer data, offer management and direct marketing into a single application.\nPrest is a recent example of the increasing demand we are seeing for this solution. As mentioned earlier, our next-generation self-checkout solution delivers a more seamless checkout experience to both new and existing retail customers. Retailers continue to focus on improving the guest experience and adopting operational efficiencies in the face of a challenging labor market. To that end, we have launched our next-gen self-checkout, with over 15 customers, including Sainsbury's, to provide retailers more agility and flexibility to improve guest experience. Based on this initial demand, we expect a broader set of customers to accelerate their implementation of this advanced technology over the next several quarters, driving additional growth for our retail segment moving forward.\nWe also have agreements with several third parties that enhance our offering for our restaurant, retail and digital banking customers. These third-party applications leverage the cloud-based architecture of our platform and generate either transaction-based or recurring revenue with healthy margins. For restaurants, we are leveraging technology from Sunday to expand our pay-at-table capabilities, enabling servers to manage more tables simultaneously. As you've seen in our recent press release, we have expanded our partnership with Olo, to bring new capabilities and integrated offerings to our enterprise customers.\nIn retail, we are partnering with Everseen, to help mitigate shrink by offering AI-enabled Evercheck technology for self-checkout. Within our digital banking business, we have partnered with MX Technologies to offer personal financial wellness tools and support.\nI would like to reiterate my confidence in our ability to execute on our growth strategy of signing new customers and converting existing customers to our platform, capitalizing on our unrivaled market position. We are prudently investing across our business to drive software and services revenue and enhance our products and services, further extending our runway for growth.\nWith that, I will turn it over to Brian, who will take you through the Q1 financial results in more detail and our outlook for the remainder of 2024.\nBrian J. Webb-Walsh\nThank you, David and good morning. As a reminder, the spin-off of NCR Atleos created some level of complexity in our 2023 and Q1 reported results, especially when looking at year-over-year comparisons. We are providing normalized results that exclude the impact of certain spin and divesture-related items. My commentary today will focus on these normalized results.\nPlease turn to Slide 11. First quarter total normalized revenue was $858 million, declining approximately 3% as expected, driven by a decline in hardware revenue as a result of the timing of customer refresh cycles. Normalized software and services revenue increased 5% for the first quarter to $662 million.\nQ1 normalized adjusted EBITDA was $122 million, which declined 2%, driven by $22 million of spin-related dissynergies and lower hardware revenue. Excluding these dissynergies, our adjusted EBITDA would have grown by 15% year-over-year. Q1 adjusted EBITDA margin was 14.2%, slightly higher than the prior year. Our Q1 adjusted EPS was $0.13 and our weighted diluted average share count was 162.7 million.\nPlease turn to Slide 12 to go through the details of our segment results. Across our segments, we saw growth in software and services revenue, which was offset by declines in hardware. Adjusted EBITDA improved across all 3 segments. This performance was consistent with our expectations. Within our restaurant segment, software and services grew 3%, offset by hardware, resulting in a revenue decline of 3%. Software and services revenue grew as we increased the number of platform and payment sites and realized price increases. Restaurants had solid profit performance with adjusted EBITDA increasing 25% and margin expanding 600 basis points, driven primarily by mix and our transformation initiatives. In retail, software and services revenue grew by 5%, offset by hardware resulting in a total revenue decline of 7%.\nThe software and services revenue growth reflects our continued success transitioning customers to the platform and expanding with those customers. As David highlighted, while the platform conversion cycle can be longer for enterprise customers, shifting our enterprise base to the platform will accelerate revenue and earnings growth over time. Adjusted EBITDA grew 4% as a result of revenue mix and our transformation initiatives. Within digital banking, Q1 revenue increased 7% as we continued to demonstrate cross-sell momentum and onboard previously signed customers. Adjusted EBITDA in this segment grew 10% and margin expanded by 90 basis points, driven by operating leverage and our transformation initiatives.\nI will now address the impact of separation on our corporate and other line. First, we have the dissynergies related to the separation. This amounted to $22 million in Q1. A portion of these dissynergies reflect both revenue and expenses net associated with the noncore spin-related businesses, which we are in the process of winding down. We anticipate that this will extend beyond 2024. In the first quarter, corporate and other also included $8 million of revenue associated with our commercial agreements with Atleos, which has a lower margin contribution. For the full year, we now expect revenue related to commercial agreements to total approximately $11 million.\nPlease turn to Slide 13. We ended the quarter with 3.9x net leverage, $2.7 billion of debt and $246 million of cash. As of March 31, under our $500 million revolving credit facility we had drawn $196 million. As expected, our leverage was higher at the end of Q1, given the use of cash based on normal seasonality. We anticipate net leverage at year-end will be approximately 3.4x. There were a few other expected items that adversely impacted our cash flow this quarter, including $32 million of spend associated with our transformation and restructuring initiatives and $5 million related to separation expenses.\nThese items include severance, professional fees and other exit costs related to rightsizing our cost base. We anticipate seeing our transformation initiatives' positive impact to margin ramp up over the coming quarters. Finally, I'd like to outline our 2024 guidance. As a reminder, our guidance does not reflect revenue or adjusted EBITDA associated with the delayed Atleos transfer countries. Given the first quarter performance and our current visibility for the year, we are reaffirming the 2024 guidance ranges that we communicated on our Q4 call.\nI'll now turn the call back to David for some additional remarks.\nDavid Wilkinson\nThanks, Brian. Before we move to Q&A, I'd like to note that this morning, we announced that Jim Kelly, the current Chairman of NCR Voyix, has now stepped into the role of Executive Chairman. I've worked closely with Jim following the spin of the Atleos business and he has been integral to the development of the go-forward strategy for NCR Voyix during his tenure at the company.\nI am excited about working more closely with Jim in his new role. He brings a wealth of experience and leadership expertise from public companies, particularly around strategic objectives, operational efficiency and payments. Given the many important initiatives that we have underway, having him in this expanded role will be invaluable to the Board and the management team.\nWith that, I will turn it over to the operator to begin the question-and-answer session. Please open the line.\nQuestion and Answer Session\nOperator\n(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Matt Summerville with D.A. Davidson.\nMatt J. Summerville\nMaybe if you guys can maybe start by just talking a little bit more broadly around what you're seeing in the hardware environment today? Obviously, that's an important top line contributor, less so on the bottom line. I totally get that but it's still an important piece to your revenue. Specifically include some comments on what you're seeing with respect to self-checkout, some of the larger projects that you had thought maybe in late '23 would end up hitting in '24, maybe an updated view there. And then I have a follow-up.\nDavid Wilkinson\nMatt, it's David. So the -- as we described, that hardware business is largely project-driven for us and is pretty lumpy. And we are seeing, in the back half of the year, those projects coming back that were pushed kind of post COVID, the bubble that we saw. So we're seeing, again, some of those projects resurface in the back half of the year. In terms of self-checkout, self-checkout for us is really a holistic solution. So we're following the consumer trends of consumers looking for different ways to checkout.\nAnd a lot of that is, we'll call it, unassisted checkout, whether that takes the form of a mobile device, a kiosk or the standard self-checkout that you know and love in terms of the appliance that sits within a large grocery chain or a large big box store. So we're going to continue to see demand. It will show up in our business a lot in software and services because that makes up a big piece of that business as the hardware thins out a little in the lane, the average selling prices decline a bit. But we see, again, continued demand. And as we described in our prepared remarks, our next-gen self-checkout is making some traction, too.\nBrian J. Webb-Walsh\nAnd I would just add that based on the projects, we expect the hardware decline to moderate in the second half versus the first half.\nMatt J. Summerville\nSo maybe as a follow-up then, Brian, along those lines, how should we be thinking about kind of the go-forward revenue and EBITDA cadence more broadly speaking, as we think about Q2 and the back half of the year relative to the $122 million of EBITDA you delivered in Q1.\nBrian J. Webb-Walsh\nYes. So consistent with what we said on our last call, because our cost transformation initiatives are ramping as we go through the year and because the hardware rate of decline is expected to moderate in the second half, we'll see revenue and adjusted EBITDA sequentially improve as we go through the year.\nOperator\nOur next question comes from Mayank Tandon with Needham & Co.\nMayank Tandon\nMaybe just diving into ARR trends, Brian or David, could you talk about what we should expect there both on the software side and in total ARR, just in terms of trend line as you progress through the year-end? And maybe you could break it down by vertical as well.\nDavid Wilkinson\nYes, I would say we're -- overall, we're pleased with the growth we're seeing in software ARR and total ARR that includes services as well. That for us is the, is what gives us confidence in the strategy of adding new customers, the customer growth we're seeing and monetizing our base of the -- largest install base in the industries that we serve. We'll continue to see, as Brian described, a similar trend in terms of sequential growth of ARR, as we look out over the quarters, that will be a trend in all 3 of the businesses, honestly.\nBrian J. Webb-Walsh\nAnd I would just add 1 point, we published for the first time a metrics file on our website, which has a lot of the financial data and KPI data, just encourage everybody to take a look at that.\nMayank Tandon\nGot it. Okay. Well, now I'll just turn to a separate question. We get this a lot from investors and I'm sure you do as well. The digital banking piece, obviously, is doing really well. And if we look at the valuations for other pure plays out there in the market, they have creeped up actually pretty meaningfully in the recent quarters. So any updates on your plans to potentially monetize the asset, just given the higher valuations in the market overall? And maybe that way, given that the synergies between digital banking and retail and restaurants, it doesn't seem to be at least obvious to investors that could be, obviously, very rewarding opportunity for shareholders over time? Any thoughts there?\nDavid Wilkinson\nYes. The digital banking business, as you saw through the results, is performing really well. We're proud of what that team has done. As I described operationally, we've consolidated that into a singular team focused on execution and we're seeing continued strong growth in that business. So right now, I agree that the value of that business is underappreciated and that's the whole intent of what we're doing, is exposing the value of that and the new NCR Voyix. That being said, we always continue to explore opportunities to maximize shareholder value.\nOperator\nOur next question comes from Kartik Mehta with Northcoast Research.\nKartik Mehta\nDave, just if you could follow up on the self-checkout. There are a lot of headlines of stores wanting to reduce their footprint in self-checkout. There's even some legislation proposed in California that they'd like to get away -- do away with self-checkout. And I'm wondering, based on that backdrop, what you're seeing in terms of your conversations with retailers in terms of demand for the product and how you'd expect that to progress over the next couple of years?\nDavid Wilkinson\nYes. We see the same articles. There -- we also -- there was 1 in the U.K., that was Simon, CEO of Sainsbury's, came out and said that their customers love self-checkout and they're continuing to deploy as we described in our relationship with them. So I'll point back, Kartik, to the consumer trend. This is really a consumer-driven trend. You and I, as consumers and shoppers are really driving the requirements for both retailers and restaurants to create unassisted ways to checkout, order or otherwise transact with their -- with these large retailers. So I think that we're going to continue to see a strong trend and what that looks like. They're all battling to differentiate the experience for both customers and they're in a labor battle for staffing stores for peak times or shifting labor to different value-added tasks as they offer new capabilities and new services.\nSo we're believing that the trend will continue. As I described earlier, it will show up in our business in software and services as well, as the hardware will take on different forms from mobile to kiosk to the full service that you've seen accepting cash in some cases. So again, we continue to have a lot of conversations around how to create better experience, guest experiences in both restaurants and retailers and that will take the form of unassisted and technology-driven solutions.\nKartik Mehta\nAnd then just as a follow-up on the hardware business. I know you talked about a little bit about what's going to happen in the first half and second half. And in the past, you've kind of talked about how 2024 is a little bit of an anomaly because of what's happened in previous years. And in 2025, you'd expect the decline to be a lot more moderated. And I'm wondering, based on kind of your outlook and what you're seeing in the pipeline, if those comments would still apply.\nDavid Wilkinson\nWe see a strong pipeline. I mean, Brian gave you the expected cadence of the numbers earlier on the answer to the other question. We're pleased with the pipeline. The pipeline is healthy and growing and it supports what we've described in terms of our reaffirmation of the full year guidance.\nKartik Mehta\nOkay. Yes. And so I was just wondering, Dave, so would your commentary in the past about 2025 being a more moderate decline, still be valid?\nDavid Wilkinson\nYes, I believe so. Everything we're seeing right now gives us indications, as Brian said, that the projects are recovering the back half of the year at this point, I would still believe that, yes.\nOperator\nOur next question comes from Erik Woodring with Morgan Stanley.\nErik William Richard Woodring\nHistorically, you haven't always quantified customers signed. And so I was just wondering if you could put some of the metrics you disclosed this morning in a bit more context, again, the nearly 300 customers signed across retail and restaurants. Can you just give us some context of maybe how that might compare to historical quarterly run rates? Was this kind of above normal, below normal? Why would that be? What's driving that? Just a little more color on how to kind of put those numbers in context would be super helpful for us.\nDavid Wilkinson\nYes, the number of customers we added this quarter, I would say, is consistent with what we expected and consistent with past performance. We have, as we've been describing, put an increased focus on investing more on the sales side and adding new customers. So it's a metric that we want to continue to expose you and the rest of the market to. Digital banking, the expansion is strong, normal seasonality in that digital banking business. We added 4 new customers, expanded relationships with 200 customers. So in addition to adding new customers, we're still seeing the strength and the expansion of the base but we'll continue to focus there and performance was in line with expectations.\nErik William Richard Woodring\nOkay. That's helpful. And then I know your goal was -- or at least you just talked about getting to about 3.4x net leverage by the end of the year. I think the longer-term goal was to get to roughly 3x net leverage. Can you just remind us, is that the longer-term target? How long will it take to get there? And second, to that, just trends in terms of free cash flow conversion. I know you're talking about this year 25% to 28%. How does that look through the year? How do we think about maybe the linearity of that? And is that the long-term run rate we should be thinking about? Does that creep higher? Just putting all of this in context to help us understand the moving pieces on the cash side would be very helpful, both for this year and then beyond this year, for any color that you'd have. And that's it for me.\nDavid Wilkinson\nYes. So starting with leverage. We -- as I said in my prepared remarks, we still expect to get to about 3.4 turns of leverage by the end of the year. And then from there, we continue -- we'll continue to focus on improving leverage to get under -- 3 or under and that, that's what we need to do and plan to do with our free cash flow generation. The cadence for free cash flow this year, we used cash in Q1 as expected. That's normal seasonality. There are certain payroll things that happened in Q1, typically and that drives cash usage. And then we're still maintaining our range of free cash flow and conversion percentages for the year and so we'd expect to see that play out balance of the year. As we get into the future years, we do think we can improve free cash flow from where we are today. We've described that before and we still feel that way.\nOperator\nOur next question comes from Matthew Roswell with RBC Capital Markets.\nMatthew Van Roswell\nI was wondering if you could expand a bit on the platform conversions and what you're seeing in terms of new clients coming on to the platform. And also, how are existing clients coming over, whether they're waiting for renewals or sort of stepping up ahead of time?\nDavid Wilkinson\nSo all of our new customers, when we describe customer adds, all of those new customers are coming on to the platform. So that's one thing I just want to ground everybody on. We did see an increase in platform sites up to 61,000, about 18% of our base. So we're seeing conversion as expected in that base. We're seeing also customers do that ahead of refresh cycles. So when you think about the demand that's out there for new capabilities, digital capabilities or guest experience, loyalty, new payment form, some of the partnerships that I mentioned in the products and partnership section of the prepared remarks, all of those capabilities are being enabled through the platform. So it starts with the platform connection and then we enable all new capabilities through that platform. So not building it back into that legacy core base.\nWe don't require an upgrade of the legacy point-of-sale on-prem. We can connect the -- our legacies' products to our platform to deliver those new capabilities. So right now, we're doing it based on customer need as they're finding new capabilities that are required, we're connecting to the platform and delivering those needs for them and a subscription for that new capability.\nOperator\nOur next question comes from Ian Zaffino with Oppenheimer.\nIsaac Arthur Sellhausen\nThis is Isaac Sellhausen on for Ian. Maybe just a follow-up on the last point. In the restaurant business, there's been a number of renewals and expansions that you've called out with customers, are the expansions pacing the way you'd like and expected? Maybe you could touch on how conversations have gone with customers, maybe how long the sales process generally takes with expanding the platform specifically within restaurant chains.\nDavid Wilkinson\nYes, I'd say we have been really pleased with the conversations that we're having with our existing customer base, both in the small and mid-market segments, as well as the enterprise customer base. The sales cycle is different depending on which segment of the market we're in, in the small to midsize, it's a much shorter sales cycle. We'll call it 3 to 6 months on the larger side, that will expand out 6 to 9 months, some extend out to 12 months. Really, the platform conversations are all about the API capabilities that we unlock with connecting to the platform and driving some of the enterprise functionality that we've been able to deliver to the enterprise customers and pushing that down back into the mid-market.\nSo some of the things that the enterprise scale players have had access to for a long time, we're now making available to our mid-market customers. So you'll see more -- we're seeing more traction. You'll see us with some more wins like we announced with Prest in that -- we'll call that mid-market-ish space where at the lower end of the enterprise where we're seeing a lot of demand and a lot of traction. So positive trends, good discussions with new customers and a lot of positive feedback from our existing base.\nIsaac Arthur Sellhausen\nOkay. That's helpful. And then just a follow-up on the transformation initiatives that you mentioned in the quarter. Is that focused on any particular business? And maybe if you could just frame, if we will see any incremental costs going forward?\nBrian J. Webb-Walsh\nYes. So the transformation initiatives, we described a $100 million cost out program, of which $70 million benefits this year and $30 million flows into next year. That program is underway and we're doing well. And it's really 3 major buckets. One is hardware design and optimization on the hardware side. The second, which is the biggest piece, about 50% is within our services business and this is doing more remote (inaudible). This is having a different skill set. Now that we're separated as 2 companies, we don't need the same skill set. Those are just 2 examples. And then the other category, about 25% is corporate expenses and real estate expenses. And so that cost program is going well.\nThe transformation and restructuring costs to achieve those cost savings that you saw in the quarter, that severance, that's -- exit costs related to rightsizing the real estate portfolio and the IT portfolio. And we expect -- if I take the separation bucket plus the transformation bucket, about $80 million to $90 million of spend this year in total, including what happened in the first quarter. And that's in line with the free cash flow guidance that we've given.\nOperator\nOur next question comes from Alex Neumann with Stephens.\nAlexander Blake Neumann\nThis is Alex on for Chuck Nabhan. Just on the restaurant segment, we had 600 basis points of margin expansion. I think you attributed that to some transformational costs. Is that margin in the mid- to high 20s, something that we should expect for that segment going forward?\nDavid Wilkinson\nIt is. We would expect that segment to be at 26% to 27% for the full year. So it is something that we'd expect to continue.\nAlexander Blake Neumann\nOkay. And then on digital banking as well, that margin also was positive after a couple of years of investment. Should we see similar margin expansion going forward? And then just how I think about revenue, could you maybe balance what the mix of ARPU versus year growth will be for that segment?\nDavid Wilkinson\nYes. So on margin, we expect margins to continue to improve for digital banking, roughly 39% for the full year, which will be up about 1% year-over-year. So we do expect EBITDA to grow faster than revenue. And we expect the revenue growth to be a combination of both the user growth and ARPU expansion as we go through the year, like we saw it was pretty good split in Q1. We'd expect that to continue.\nOperator\nOur next question comes from Matt Summerville with D.A. Davidson.\nMatt J. Summerville\nJust a couple of quick follow-ups. Brian, to that $80 million to $90 million of cash related severance, et cetera, costs you expect to encounter this year, I realize it's early, what does that number roughly look like, as you're thinking about '25, I guess how much can that tail off and therefore, accrete to the company's free cash flow profile? And then I have a follow-up.\nBrian J. Webb-Walsh\nYes, that definitely does come down over time. Separation is a component of that, that's separation-related, which goes away completely. And then the part that's around rightsizing the cost base, we'll always have incremental cost (inaudible) to do as we go forward but we would expect that number to come down and that would be a help to free cash flow. In addition, as we improve our leverage and reduce our debt, the interest reduction would be a help to free cash flow, holding CapEx steady as a percent of revenue -- or would help as we go forward or actually holding CapEx steady and improving it as a percent of revenue with free cash flow. So those are the drivers that give us confidence that we can improve free cash flow as we go forward.\nMatt J. Summerville\nGot it. And then maybe talk -- spend some time talking about customer adds in the businesses. I was wondering if you can maybe touch on what your attrition rates have been looking like in retail restaurants and digital banking and how that maybe compares to even just 1 year or 2 years ago, again, with a focus on all 3 reportable segments, please.\nDavid Wilkinson\nYes. I would tell you that -- we'll run through all the segments. So we're focused on adding net new customers and we feel like we're making traction there. On the -- we are pretty enterprise-heavy focused. So we see strong retention of our enterprise customers, specifically on the retail side. When I get to the restaurant business, again, enterprise side, we see strong retention of our customer base, adding net new customers, so taking share. And then on the smaller end of that, we see the normal -- some of the normal churn happening at that small base. We could see that up to 10% in that small side of the business as customers -- as our restaurant customers go out of business.\nOn digital banking, we continue to see very strong renewal rates. We're renewing 90-plus percent of our contracts and then if you look at the net retention rate on revenue and actually, we're seeing some strengthening of price and then we're expanding, like we did with the 200 customers, expanding ARPU with our existing base by cross-selling and up-selling across the capabilities as we move to operationalize as a singular portfolio from the market into that market segment. So overall, we're feeling good about it with really normal kind of attrition trends that we've seen continuing.\nMatt J. Summerville\nThen just lastly, that comment on price. Is that sort of new on the digital banking side? I guess I was under the impression last quarter, maybe with all the renewal activity you were seeing a maybe slight amount of price compression. And then just broadly speaking on price, are you net positive price capture in each of the 3 segments?\nDavid Wilkinson\nSo with digital banking, on renewal, we do typically see price compression but that price compression has been improving over the last 3 or 4 quarters. And then outside of price compression at renewal in all 3 businesses, we go after capturing CPI-related price increases and so we get benefits in each of the 3 segments around that.\nOperator\nThere are no further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the floor back over to David Wilkinson for closing comments.\nDavid Wilkinson\nThank you. In closing, I'd like to thank all of our customers again for the trust that they put in us every day to help them achieve their strategic objectives. I'd also like to thank again our NCR Voyix colleagues for their contributions to our successes up to now and our investors for their ongoing support. As I stated earlier, we remain committed to serving our existing customers and bringing them on the platform journey in addition to adding new customers. Our platform investments over the past years have provided real value to our customers and we're going to continue to connect them to the platform. We built a solid foundation for growth within our base and growth of new customers, specifically in mid-market. And while we're proud of where we are, we need to do better at turning this foundation into growth and this focus will show up in our results. I believe in the plan that we've outlined today and I believe in this management team to execute. Thank you and look forward to updating you on our continued progress on our Q2 call.\nOperator\nThis concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time.

Much to improve on with their communications.\u201d\nArgos, which is owned by Sainsbury\u2019s, was also affected by the software update, meaning some customers may have had issues ordering new items or collecting orders in-store.\nIt said there may have been delays in fulfilling orders placed.\nOnly a small proportion of Tesco orders due for delivery on Saturday were impacted, it is understood.\nTesco customers received an email if their order was disrupted, and if it was cancelled they were not charged.\nIn-store shopping and placing orders on the app and website are not believed to have been affected.\nTesco said: \u201cThe vast majority of our online orders are being delivered as normal, but due to a technical issue earlier today we have had to cancel a small number of orders.\n\u201cWe are contacting affected customers directly, and we\u2019re really sorry for the inconvenience.\u201d",

        "text": "Shoppers visiting a Sainsbury\u2019s supermarket in the late 90s were met with an unusual sight. Alongside the melons and dishwasher soap was a red telephone that let them \u201cdial a banker\u201d. The ploy was part of Sainsbury\u2019s push to become a fully fledged bank.\nIn theory, the venture made sense: Sainsbury\u2019s was a trusted brand and was visited by millions of customers regularly. But in practice, branching out beyond fruit and veg has proved difficult.\nFast forward to today and the dream is over. Sainsbury\u2019s has called time on its foray into the banking sector after announcing plans to wind down its financial services operations.\nThe retailer said it was planning a \u201cphased withdrawal\u201d of Sainsbury\u2019s Bank after conducting a strategic review. There will be no immediate changes to the products or services it provides to customers.\nThe supermarket is now looking at a range of options, including outsourcing the business to a financial services provider that could continue to offer banking products under the Sainsbury\u2019s brand.\nThe move promises to bring the curtain down on nearly three decades of direct banking by Sainsbury\u2019s and follows a recent move from rival Tesco to explore a sale of Tesco Bank.\nThe retreat of Britain\u2019s two largest supermarkets from the banking world underlines the difficulty of competing with the \u201cBig Four\u201d \u2014 Barclays, Natwest, Lloyds and HSBC.\n\u201cAt the end of the day, where do you want to put your money?,\u201d says former Sainsbury\u2019s chairman Sir Philip Hampton.\n\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t buy your potatoes from HSBC, probably because you\u2019re not sure they have a particular capability of selling potatoes.\u201d\nSainsbury\u2019s launched into financial services in 1997 and today has around 1.9m customers. Its bank offers a range of products, including credit cards, insurance, loans and saving accounts. The bank is best known for its orange ATMs, with around 1,350 across the country.\n\u201cI remember the Sainsbury\u2019s Bank being set up and it did okay but it never did particularly well,\u201d says Sir Philip. \u201cIt was a customer service thing to have the ATM in the supermarkets so that people could do cash transactions. But the business has never obviously achieved scale, and probably never can.\u201d\nQuestions over Sainsbury\u2019s commitment to its financial services division have been buzzing for years.\nThe supermarket previously tried to sell Sainsbury\u2019s Bank, attracting interest from prospective buyers such as Centerbridge Partners, but talks ended in 2021 after it concluded a sale did not offer good value for shareholders.\nTesco has similarly been trying to offload its bank, which employs 3,540 people and boasts 5.2m customers. It recently hired Goldman Sachs to explore a sale and HSBC, Lloyds and Barclays have all been flagged as possible suitors.",

        "title": "J Sainsbury (LON:SBRY) Has Affirmed Its Dividend Of \u00a30.039",
        "author": "",
        "date": "Sun, 05 Nov 2023 07:23:00 GMT",
        "text": "The board of J Sainsbury plc (LON:SBRY) has announced that it will pay a dividend of \u00a30.039 per share on the 15th of December. This means the dividend yield will be fairly typical at 4.8%.\nSee our latest analysis for J Sainsbury\nJ Sainsbury's Earnings Easily Cover The Distributions\nWe like to see a healthy dividend yield, but that is only helpful to us if the payment can continue. Prior to this announcement, the company was paying out 395% of what it was earning and 89% of cash flows. This indicates that the company could be more focused on returning cash to shareholders than reinvesting to grow the business.\nAnalysts expect a massive rise in earnings per share in the next year. Assuming the dividend continues along recent trends, we estimate that the payout ratio could reach 58%, which is in a comfortable range for us.\nDividend Volatility\nThe company's dividend history has been marked by instability, with at least one cut in the last 10 years. The dividend has gone from an annual total of \u00a30.164 in 2013 to the most recent total annual payment of \u00a30.131. Doing the maths, this is a decline of about 2.2% per year. A company that decreases its dividend over time generally isn't what we are looking for.\nDividend Growth Potential Is Shaky\nGiven that the dividend has been cut in the past, we need to check if earnings are growing and if that might lead to stronger dividends in the future. J Sainsbury's EPS has fallen by approximately 22% per year during the past five years. This steep decline can indicate that the business is going through a tough time, which could constrain its ability to pay a larger dividend each year in the future. On the bright side, earnings are predicted to gain some ground over the next year, but until this turns into a pattern we wouldn't be feeling too comfortable.\nThe Dividend Could Prove To Be Unreliable\nOverall, we don't think this company makes a great dividend stock, even though the dividend wasn't cut this year. The track record isn't great, and the payments are a bit high to be considered sustainable. We don't think J Sainsbury is a great stock to add to your portfolio if income is your focus.\nInvestors generally tend to favour companies with a consistent, stable dividend policy as opposed to those operating an irregular one. At the same time, there are other factors our readers should be conscious of before pouring capital into a stock. Taking the debate a bit further, we've identified 3 warning signs for J Sainsbury that investors need to be conscious of moving forward. Looking for more high-yielding dividend ideas?

        "text": "Key Insights\nThe projected fair value for J Sainsbury is UK\u00a34.49 based on 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity\nJ Sainsbury's UK\u00a32.56 share price signals that it might be 43% undervalued\nOur fair value estimate is 66% higher than J Sainsbury's analyst price target of UK\u00a32.70\nDoes the October share price for J Sainsbury plc (LON:SBRY) reflect what it's really worth? Today, we will estimate the stock's intrinsic value by estimating the company's future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. Our analysis will employ the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. There's really not all that much to it, even though it might appear quite complex.\nWe generally believe that a company's value is the present value of all of the cash it will generate in the future. However, a DCF is just one valuation metric among many, and it is not without flaws. If you still have some burning questions about this type of valuation, take a look at the Simply Wall St analysis model.\nView our latest analysis for J Sainsbury\nIs J Sainsbury Fairly Valued?\nWe're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.\nGenerally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate:\n10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast\n2024\n2025\n2026\n2027\n2028\n2029\n2030\n2031\n2032\n2033\nLevered FCF (\u00a3, Millions)\nUK\u00a3429.0m\nUK\u00a3447.5m\nUK\u00a3574.5m\nUK\u00a3710.0m\nUK\u00a3742.0m\nUK\u00a3766.1m\nUK\u00a3786.7m\nUK\u00a3804.7m\nUK\u00a3821.0m\nUK\u00a3836.0m\nGrowth Rate Estimate Source\nAnalyst x2\nAnalyst x2\nAnalyst x2\nAnalyst x1\nAnalyst x1\nEst @ 3.25%\nEst @ 2.69%\nEst @ 2.29%\nEst @ 2.02%\nEst @ 1.83%\nPresent Value (\u00a3, Millions) Discounted @ 7.9%\nUK\u00a3397\nUK\u00a3384\nUK\u00a3457\nUK\u00a3523\nUK\u00a3506\nUK\u00a3484\nUK\u00a3461\nUK\u00a3437\nUK\u00a3413\nUK\u00a3389\n(\"Est\" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)\nPresent Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = UK\u00a34.5b\nWe now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (1.4%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 7.9%.\nTerminal Value (TV)= FCF2033 \u00d7 (1 + g) \u00f7 (r \u2013 g) = UK\u00a3836m\u00d7 (1 + 1.4%) \u00f7 (7.9%\u2013 1.4%) = UK\u00a313b\nPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= UK\u00a313b\u00f7 ( 1 + 7.9%)10= UK\u00a36.0b\nThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is UK\u00a310b. In the final step we divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of UK\u00a32.6, the company appears quite undervalued at a 43% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind.\nImportant Assumptions\nWe would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at J Sainsbury as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.9%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.111. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.\nSWOT Analysis for J Sainsbury\nStrength\nDebt is not viewed as a risk.\nWeakness\nEarnings declined over the past year.\nDividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Consumer Retailing market.\nOpportunity\nAnnual earnings are forecast to grow faster than the British market.\nTrading below our estimate of fair value by more than 20%.\nThreat\nDividends are not covered by earnings.\nAnnual revenue is forecast to grow slower than the British market.\nMoving On:\nWhilst important, the DCF calculation shouldn't be the only metric you look at when researching a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation. For example, changes in the company's cost of equity or the risk free rate can significantly impact the valuation. Can we work out why the company is trading at a discount to intrinsic value?

Among those, Which? found a third of the products at Sainsburys (34%) of 71 products were the \u2018regular\u2019 price and 24% of 70 products at Tesco, just a few days before getting discounted.\nThe analysis found that an average everyday grocery basket using a loyalty card had a saving of 6.4% at Tesco and 2% at Sainsbury\u2019s.\nAmong the potentially risky deals, Which?\u2019s investigation revealed Sainsbury\u2019s advertised a jar of Nescaf\u00e9 Gold Blend Instant Coffee (200g) for \u00a36 with a Nectar card \u2013 a saving of \u00a32.10 on the \u2018regular\u2019 price of \u00a38.10. But the regular price had also been \u00a36 at Sainsbury\u2019s until it went up to \u00a38.10 just two days before the Nectar price launched.\nWhich? also found the \u2018regular\u2019 Sainsbury\u2019s price was much higher than at other supermarkets. At Asda, the same jar was \u00a37, while at Morrisons, Ocado and Waitrose it was \u00a36, \u00a35.99 at Tesco and \u00a35.49 at Lidl.\nSimilarly, at Tesco Which? found Heinz Salad Cream (605g) with a Clubcard price of \u00a33.50 and a \u2018regular\u2019 price of \u00a33.90 however its regular price had been \u00a32.99 for several weeks before it was increased to \u00a33.90 - just 22 days before the Clubcard promotion. It had been at its \u2018regular\u2019 price for only 25 days out of 183, over the period of 6 months.",

We hope that all the funding will help towards building lasting change for these children and their families.\u201d\nThe collaboration marks the 25th anniversary of Sainsbury\u2019s and Comic Relief\u2019s partnership, a testament to their enduring commitment to supporting communities across the UK.\nTo date, Sainsbury\u2019s says it has raised more than \u00a3170m for Comic Relief.",

        "text": "UK-based supermarket Sainsbury\u2019s has reported a solid first quarter (Q1) of 2024 with a 3% rise in its underlying sales.\nHowever, this growth was driven by strong grocery sales, which rose 4.8%, offsetting a decline in the retailer\u2019s non-food categories.\nThe positive grocery performance reflects Sainsbury\u2019s focus on value and quality.\nThe retailer has been steadily winning market share for 15 months straight, with customers choosing it for their main weekly shop.\nThis success is attributed to initiatives such as matching budget supermarket Aldi\u2018s prices on essentials and offering attractive deals through its Nectar loyalty programme.\nSee Also:\nAmazon to invest $2.1bn in Delivery Service Partner programme\nAssociated Food Stores adopts Birdzi\u2019s customer intelligence platform\nEarlier this month, Sainsbury\u2019s launched a new initiative to reward customers with Nectar points when they use its ultra-rapid electric vehicle (EV) charging service, Smart Charge.\nIn doing so, the supermarket reportedly became the first EV charging provider in the UK to integrate a national loyalty scheme with its service.\nWhile grocery sales are a bright spot for the company, non-food and clothing sales fell 4.3%.\nThis can be partly explained by unseasonal weather conditions in the country that dampened demand for summer items such as paddling pools and garden furniture.\nAdditionally, Argos, Sainsbury\u2019s subsidiary, saw a 6.2% decline in sales compared to a strong performance last year.\nWeaker consumer electronics demand, particularly in gaming, further impacted Argos\u2019 results.\nDespite the headwinds in non-food sectors, Sainsbury\u2019s remains optimistic. It expects full-year retail operating profit to grow between 5% and 10%.\nThis confidence stems from its ongoing cost-saving efforts and investments in technology.\nA noteworthy move is its partnership with Microsoft to leverage AI for enhancing customer experiences and improving operational efficiency.\nLooking ahead, Sainsbury\u2019s acknowledges the cautious consumer behaviour due to the ongoing cost-of-living crisis. It anticipates this trend to continue until interest rates potentially decrease.\nOverall, Sainsbury\u2019s Q1 results paint a mixed picture. While grocery sales are a clear success story, non-food categories face challenges.\nThe company\u2019s focus on value, innovation, and technology adoption positions it well to navigate the current market environment.",

Sainsbury\u2019s has acknowledged that customers are more cautious when shopping for general merchandise categories, and promotional events and sales have found resonance.

However, there were also some disappointing range performances and in the fourth quarter we experienced availability challenges on some core lines, both of which are being addressed in plans for the year ahead.\u201d\nSainsbury\u2019s explained its ambition is to deliver more food choice to more customers as it noted that currently only 15% of its grocery stores carry its full food range.\nSee Also:\nIn data: Leather footwear tops export value while rubber, plastic lead volume\nJust Style Excellence Awards 2024: Noble Biomaterials\nTo do this, it plans to bring more of its range to more customers by re-allocating space currently used for general merchandise and clothing to food.\nThe retailer said: \u201cWe will focus on around 180 of our highest potential stores over the next three years.\u201d\nSainsbury\u2019s also shared that its general merchandise and clothing inside its stores will become more aligned to customers\u2019 grocery missions in future in a bid to ensure ranges are \u201cmore relevant and desirable\u201d.\nSimpson-Gould pointed out that while Sainsbury\u2019s outperformed the food and grocery market in 2023 (+8.3%), it continues to struggle in its general merchandise and clothing categories with both sectors failing to provide positive growth past the first quarter.\nShe added: \u201cThe grocer\u2019s Food First strategy, launched in November 2020, has correctly been replaced with the Next Level Sainsbury\u2019s strategy update, which encapsulates a wider focus on retaining momentum in grocery sales and addressing the problem child of its non-food proposition, but will require adept and rapid roll out to provide positive sales momentum to counter declines in food and grocery sales expected in Sainsbury\u2019s first half.\u201d\nGeneral merchandise (including Argos) declined 0.5%, with Simpson-Gould stating it suffered particularly poor growth in Q4 where sales fell 5.6%.\nShe believes that despite the continued absorption of Argos standalone stores into Sainsbury\u2019s formats, Sainsbury\u2019s is yet to find the winning formula to secure sustained sales momentum, as customers continue to prioritise spend on essential goods and services as opposed to categories such as clothing.\nSimpson-Gould added: \u201cWith food sales growth now receding, Sainsbury\u2019s Next Level strategy proposition must be rolled out swiftly. The grocer has positioned Argos as a core pillar to drive non-essential category growth by 2027, recognising the poor frequency of purchase rate from customers, it must ensure that promises to improve range and convenience are followed through before the end of this new financial year to fend off competition from the likes of Dunelm and Amazon.\u201d\nMost critically, she concluded: \u201cIn this new strategy update are plans to enhance Sainsbury\u2019s non-food categories through tailored ranges to local customer shopping journeys, enhanced visual merchandising and a tightening focus on ranges. By reducing and reformatting its general merchandise and clothing store space to prioritise full food range expansion, this new strategy will require informed and agile merchandising range reviews to ensure that further sales declines are not incurred.\u201d\nIn January Sainsbury\u2019s blamed unseasonably warm weather for its decline in Tu clothing range sales over the Christmas period.",

        "text": "The Bank of England has been accused of making a \u201cpolitical decision\u201d after holding interest rates at a 16-year high despite inflation falling to its target.\nConservative MPs accused officials on the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of being unfairly and unduly swayed by the upcoming election.\nRishi Sunak\u2019s last hope of a cut to borrowing costs before the general election was dashed on Thursday after the MPC voted to keep interest rates at 5.25pc.\nThe decision to maintain borrowing costs at the same level for the seventh consecutive meeting came despite inflation falling back to the Bank\u2019s 2pc target this week.\nSir Jacob Rees-Mogg, a former business secretary, said: \u201cIt is a political decision by the Bank of England. Inflation is now on target and rates need to be cut.\n\u201cThat we are in an election period ought to make no difference but the Bank has made a decision based on short-term politics rather than economics.\u201d\nThe minutes of the MPC\u2019s latest meeting said the election \u201cwas not relevant\u201d to the decision to hold interest rates unchanged.\n\u201cThe committee noted that the timing of the general election on 4 July was not relevant to its decision at this meeting, which would as usual be made on the basis of what was judged necessary to achieve the 2pc inflation target sustainably in the medium term,\u201d the minutes said.\nHowever, Bob Blackman, a senior Conservative standing for re-election, said: \u201cYou\u2019ve got to ask the question why they are not cutting. They have got to justify the decision not to cut interest rates.\u201d\nDanny Kruger, a Conservative MP and former member of the Treasury select committee, said the Bank had held rates too high for too long. He said: \u201cRates should have come down at the last meeting and it\u2019s a great shame the MPC are holding off yet again.\n\u201cInflation is now back to target and businesses and mortgage holders badly need a rate cut to get the economy growing again.\u201d\nAndrew Bailey, the Bank\u2019s Governor, said borrowing costs needed to stay higher for longer to squeeze lingering price pressures out of the economy. While headline inflation has fallen back to target, prices in the dominant services sector are still rising faster than officials would like.\nMr Bailey said: \u201cIt\u2019s good news that inflation has returned to our 2pc target. We need to be sure that inflation will stay low and that\u2019s why we\u2019ve decided to hold rates at 5.25pc for now.\u201d\nThe Bank\u2019s decision also faced criticism from the Left. George Dibb, an economist at the Left-leaning think tank the Institute for Public Policy Research, said high rates were holding back the economy.\nHe said: \u201cThe Bank of England has tightened the screws too much for too long, holding back the UK\u2019s economic recovery. It should have followed the European Central Bank by starting to cut rates today.\u201d\nThe Bank was widely expected to leave rates on hold, with many economists predicting that it could begin cutting for the first time in four years at the next meeting in August. Money markets predict interest rates will be reduced no later than November.\nThe MPC said it \u201cremains prepared to adjust monetary policy as warranted by economic data\u201d.\nThe committee added: \u201cAs part of the August forecast round, members of the committee will consider all of the information available and how this affects the assessment that the risks from inflation persistence are receding.\u201d\nOf the MPC\u2019s nine members, only two \u2013 Swati Dhingra and Sir Dave Ramsden \u2013 voted to cut the Bank Rate to 5pc. The remaining seven, including the Governor, voted to hold.\nFor some of these policymakers, \u201cthe policy decision was finely balanced\u201d, the minutes of the MPC meeting showed. The remarks will be taken as a sign that rate cuts could soon be on the way.\nRecent falls in the headline rate of inflation have largely been driven by falling energy bills, linked to fluctuating prices in international markets.\nMr Bailey and his colleagues fear underlying price pressures in the domestic economy are still lingering. Services prices are still rising by 5.7pc annually, which the MPC said is \u201csomewhat higher than projected\u201d.\nAt the same time, the average worker\u2019s earnings in the three months to April were up 5.9pc, still far above the Bank\u2019s target. Surveys of businesses indicate companies expect pay settlements to average 5.7pc this year.\n\u201cMonetary policy will need to remain restrictive for sufficiently long to return inflation to the 2pc target sustainably,\u201d the MPC said.\nHowever, it admitted that somewhat lower interest rates could still fulfil this goal: \u201cThe stance of monetary policy could remain restrictive even if Bank Rate were to be reduced, given that it was starting from an already restrictive level.\u201d\nNo change was made to the pace of quantitative tightening. The Bank now holds \u00a3696bn of government bonds, down from \u00a3875bn at the peak of the quantitative easing programme.\nRead the latest updates below.",

To retain their market shares, Tesco, Sainsbury\u2019s, ASDA and Morrisons must ensure that their prices and offers are more competitive both online and instore, also leveraging their loyalty schemes where available to keep shoppers from switching to discounters.\nAt the other end of the sector, upper midmarket and premium cosmetic brands such as MAC, Charlotte Tilbury and Fenty Beauty are encouraging younger shoppers to trade up from cheaper drugstore brands such as L\u2019Or\u00e9al. With greater awareness and interest in cult products driven by bloggers and celebrities on social media, millennials are increasingly buying into more premium brands. This is drawing spend away from the likes of Boots and grocers to department stores, brands\u2019 own channels and online pureplays like ASOS, Amazon, Lookfantastic and Feelunique.\nWhile midmarket department stores such as House of Fraser and Debenhams have recently struggled to halt sales declines within clothing & footwear, they have continued to focus on health & beauty to drive sales. Both midmarket and premium department stores such as Selfridges and Harvey Nichols have secured brand and product exclusives or have introduced brands with limited availability \u2013 such as Hourglass, Charlotte Tilbury, Fenty Beauty and The Ordinary \u2013 and will continue to benefit from increased footfall as a result of this.\nBoots, which announced yesterday that it had seen a 3.3% fall in its like-for-like retail sales in the three months to 28th February 2018, must invest in its branded offer, ensuring this is up-to-date and relevant, as competitor Superdrug continues to do. As Glossier only has an online presence in the UK, it is an emergent brand which Boots could stock within its stores and online to attract younger shoppers. Glossier has more accessible price points compared to more premium and designer brands such as Clinique, Dior and Chanel and the brand would encourage younger customers to trade up from the likes of Rimmel and NYX, and support Boots\u2019 future growth within skincare and cosmetics \u2013 two of the fastest growing categories out to 2023.",

We\u2019re saddened by the company\u2019s audacity in telling shoppers that things are being expertly, freshly baked and amazed that they\u2019ve been allowed to continue making such claims.\u201d\nOn 28 May, Real Bread Campaign sent its complaint to Hertfordshire County Council, the local authority with the primary authority relationship with Tesco for trading standards.\nSimilar grievances have been expressed by the campaign group about claims made by Co-op, Morrisons and Lidl and complaints have been lodged with their relevant trading standards authorities.\nJust Food has asked all the supermarket groups concerned for their response to the campaign group\u2019s complaints.\nA Sainsbury\u2019s spokesperson said: \u201cWe reviewed our bakery services and recipes earlier this year to make sure we can make good food affordable for everyone.\n\u201cMore of our stores now bake pre-prepared dough in-store, as it allows us to offer customers the best quality in-store bakery products at great value. Our bakery items are also clearly labelled in line with legislation and trading standards.\u201d\nA Tesco spokesperson said: \u201cWe\u2019re proud of our colleagues who freshly bake great quality, affordable bread in hundreds of our stores \u2013 and have done so since we opened our first in-store bakery in 1968.\n\u201cIn some stores where we don\u2019t have the space to bake everything from scratch, we work closely with our bakery suppliers who prepare dough for us that trained colleagues bake every day in store.\n\u201cThe signage we use in each individual store reflects the different ways we prepare bread and our approach has been agreed with our trading standards primary authority.\u201d\nA Co-op spokesperson said: \u201cAs a convenience retailer, we pride ourselves on offering an affordable and great quality in-store bakery range for our member owners and customers \u2013 including our much-loved Irresistible sourdough baguette which is freshly prepared and baked by trained colleagues across our stores every day.\u201d",
