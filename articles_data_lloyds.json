        "text": "The Barclay family has regained ownership of The Telegraph after paying \u00a31.2bn in debts owed to Lloyds Banking Group.\nThe high street lender said repayment had been made in full, meaning both The Telegraph and The Spectator magazine have been released from receivership.\nCourt proceedings brought on behalf of Lloyds against the Barclay family in the British Virgin Islands, which would have liquidated one of their key holding companies, have also now been called off. A hearing had been scheduled for Monday.\nThe move effectively ends Lloyds\u2019 involvement in the complex sale of The Telegraph and The Spectator, with ownership of both titles spinning back to the Barclay family.\nThe repayment by the Barclay family was funded by a \u00a31.2bn loan from RedBirdIMI, an Abu Dhabi-backed fund that plans to take control of the titles through a complex debt-for-equity swap.\nHowever, Culture Secretary Lucy Frazer last week issued a \u201chold separate\u201d order that prohibits ownership from being transferred to RedBird IMI until a public interest investigation is completed.\nThe order also prevents The Telegraph being merged with any other entity. In addition, it blocks any changes in management or the removal of key editorial staff.\n Last week, Ms Frazer blocked an Abu Dhabi-backed fund from taking control of The Telegraph Credit: Shutterstock/Thomas Krych\nBoth The Telegraph and The Spectator will continue to be overseen by a trio of independent directors while the Government carries out its review, amid concerns about foreign state ownership and press freedom.\nRedBird IMI is a joint venture between RedBird, a US private equity firm, and International Media Investments (IMI), an Abu Dhabi vehicle backed by the Manchester City owner Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed al-Nahyan.\nIMI is providing 75pc of the \u00a3600m price for The Telegraph and The Spectator, though the bid is being fronted by former CNN chief Jeff Zucker.\nThe deal has sparked concerns given the UAE\u2019s authoritarian leadership and track record of press censorship.\nSenior figures including Lord Hague have called for the takeover to be blocked, while Tory MPs have written to Deputy Prime Minister Oliver Dowden urging him to intervene on national security grounds.\nMs Frazer has issued a Public Interest Intervention Notice (PIIN), which triggered investigations by the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) and media regulator Ofcom.\nOfcom will examine the impact of the deal on the need for accurate presentation of news and free expression of opinion in newspapers, while the CMA will look at potential competition issues.\nBoth watchdogs have opened a call for evidence allowing interested parties to comment over the coming fortnight. They must report back to the Culture Secretary by January 26.\nRival suitors, whose bids were derailed by RedBird IMI\u2019s swoop, are expected to lobby against the UAE-backed takeover in their responses.\nThey include a consortium led by the hedge fund founder Sir Paul Marshall and DMGT, the publisher of The Daily Mail.\nMelanie Dawes, the chief executive of Ofcom, has recused herself from the review as she is married to Ben Brogan, the head of public affairs at Lloyds.\nRedBird IMI has said it is committed to maintaining the editorial independence of the titles, adding that it would cooperate fully with the Government and regulators.\nA spokesman for Lloyds confirmed that the Barclay debt had been repaid, adding: \u201cWe are always keen to work constructively with customers who get into difficulty with their repayments to reach an amicable solution. We\u2019d like to thank all parties for their role in reaching this point.\u201d\nA spokesman for the Barclay family said: \u201cWe are pleased to have reached this positive resolution and are grateful to Lloyds Banking Group for their constructive engagement over recent months.\u201d\nLloyds inherited the loans after buying Halifax Bank of Scotland, which lent the money to the Barclay family in the mid 2000s. The debt comprised a \u00a3700m loan plus \u00a3400m of interest run up.\nThe repayment marks a surprise windfall for Lloyds, which had written down the value of the loan on its books. Analysts expect Lloyds chief Charlie Nunn to use the money to fund a payout to shareholders at the company\u2019s annual results in February.\nMany of our readers have raised concerns over the potential sale of Telegraph Media Group to the Abu Dhabi-linked Redbird IMI. While Ofcom carries out its investigation, we are inviting the submission of comments on the process. Email salecomments@telegraph.co.uk to have your say.",

According to a report in The Times, the claim asserts that the banks enabled Arena TV\u2019s directors to commit significant fraud against multiple lenders.\nKroll alleges that Richard Yeowart, Arena\u2019s owner, and Robert Hopkinson, its co-director, misappropriated over \u00a31.2 billion in proceeds from asset-based lending involving more than 55 different lenders. The misappropriated funds represent one of the largest frauds in the history of UK asset-based lending (ABL), as reported by the Sunday Times in December 2021.\nFEATURE: Arena Television\u2019s absconded directors and lessors\u2019 missing millions\nNEWS: Unlocked office of Arena TV ex-boss yields \u00a31m in broadcasting equipment\nFEATURE: No silver bullet to fighting leasing fraud but 5G offers hope\nNEWS: Lombard joins Acquis Lumia in effort to fight UK fraud\nHow well do you really know your competitors?\nAccess the most comprehensive Company Profiles on the market, powered by GlobalData.

According to the AFP, police seized gold bullion, cash, two cars, and two homes valued at \u20ac1.4 million (\u00a31.2m), alongside fake identity cards, counterfeit driving licences, and wigs.\nThe Serious Fraud Office has also launched an investigation into the matter.

        "text": "Lloyds Bank profits were hit by a rush of homeowners refinancing their mortgages as households sought to take advantage of better rates.\nHigher levels of mortgage refinancing between January and March led to more churn in Lloyds\u2019 mortgage book, denting the bank\u2019s profitability.\nThe bank\u2019s net interest margin (Nim), which measures the difference between what lenders earn on loans and mortgages, and what they pay savers, fell to 2.95pc from 3.22pc last year.\nLloyds\u2019 mortgage book was down \u00a31.8bn in the first quarter overall as customers refinanced their mortgages.\nHomeowners hit the pause button when it came to fixing their mortgages at the end of last year owing to economic uncertainty over rates, but moved quickly to take advantage of better deals at the beginning of this year, Lloyds said.\nFinance chief William Chalmers said the refinancing \u201coverhang\u201d from the end of 2023 had been expected by the bank.\nHe said: \u201cThis represented customers just pausing in terms of their willingness to re-engage in the mortgage market, and choosing to do so in the first quarter instead.\u201d\nThe group posted a \u00a31.6bn pre-tax profit in the first quarter, which was about \u00a334m below analyst forecasts and down by 28pc compared with a year earlier. Revenues were \u00a34.5bn\nCharlie Nunn, chief executive of Lloyds, is midway through an ambitious four-year turnaround.\n Mr Nunn hopes to kickstart growth at the bank with his four year shakeup plan\nHe is seeking to make Lloyds a slimmer and more profitable bank, cutting costs and boosting sales by offering customers more products such as wealth management services and insurance.\nMr Nunn said: \u201cThe group is continuing to deliver in line with expectations in the first quarter of 2024, with solid net income, cost discipline and strong asset quality.\u201d\nLloyds, which owns Halifax, is one of the UK\u2019s largest mortgage providers.\nThe bank issued an upbeat assessment for the housing market and the UK economy.\nMr Chalmers said mortgage applications were up 20pc versus the same period last year, but expects this to slow during the rest of 2024.\nThe lender has stuck by its interest rate cut forecasts by the Bank of England, and still predicts three rate cuts this year with the first occurring during the summer.\nLloyds also said it took no further charges related to the potential impact of the motor finance investigation by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA).\nThe bank booked a \u00a3450m provision related to the possible costs of the redress scheme in February.\nThe FCA is investigating a number of lenders over historic commissions paid to car dealers linked to the rate of interest charged to borrowers buying a vehicle.\nCosts at the bank rose more than expected during the period, mainly because of the impact of a Bank of England levy charged on all banks.",

        "text": "The British community abandoned by banks \u2013 where it costs \u00a3240 to visit a branch\nAlmost two banks close in Britain every day. Since January 2015, 5,934 branches have shut, according to consumer group Which? \u2013 at a rate of 54 per month. If the closures continue at the same pace, we will be left bankless within a decade.\nThere is one part of Britain which is already living in this dystopia.\nRobert Francis is standing outside the derelict and deserted Lloyds Bank building in Hugh Street, St Mary\u2019s \u2013 the largest of five inhabited islands which make up the Isles of Scilly.\nLloyds shut its doors for good almost two years ago to the day, leaving Scilly without a bank for the first time in at least 70 years.\nRust now streaks across the walls of the 19th century Grade I-listed building. The paint is peeling on the once-grand pillars at its entrance and, last month, the building had to be cordoned off after slate tiles from the roof came loose and threatened to rain down on passersby.\nLocal politician Francis, who is chairman of the Council of the Isles of Scilly, is seething. \u201cIt\u2019s a blot on our public realm,\u201d he says. \u201cWe are trying to make the place look lovely and they are an absolute eyesore. They left it in a disgusting state.\u201d\nIt\u2019s not just Lloyds that has upped sticks. A few hundred yards away lies the empty Barclays building, the first of the two banks to abandon the isolated community when it closed in 2018.\nIf any of the 2,100 islanders want to visit their bank in person, they need to cross the sea. They can do this either by flying to Land\u2019s End airport and then relying on an infrequent bus to take them to Penzance or, in the summer months, they can take a direct ferry.\nHowever, because of the timings of the ferry, islanders have to pay for a night\u2019s accommodation in Penzance before getting the next one back the following morning.\nIf an islander wanted to visit their nearest bank next Monday, even for just a 30-minute appointment, it would take almost eight-and-a-half hours and cost at least \u00a3142.\nThe journey begins at St Mary\u2019s airport at 7.50am, one hour before departure on the 17-seater plane to Land\u2019s End. Despite landing at 9.10am, there\u2019s no bus for another 73 minutes. One hour, three minutes and two bus transfers later, they would arrive in Penzance at 11.26am. Even if they left the bank by midday, there\u2019s no bus back to the airport until 1pm, meaning they\u2019d be back at the airport for 2pm, before an almost two hour wait for the flight, which lands back in Scilly at 4.15pm.\nThis all assumes there are no delays, which is a common occurrence. Transport to the islands is disrupted up to a third of the year, with poor visibility often delaying flights and high winds cancelling ferries.\nLloyds and Barclays have both defended their closures, pointing to a dwindling customer base which used the branches and the increasing number of people using online and mobile banking.\nLloyds said 71pc of islanders used other ways to do their personal banking and branch transactions fell by 47pc between 2016 and 2020. Barclays said 73pc of its Scilly customers were using alternative methods to bank, and that nationally 98pc of customer interactions are now carried out digitally.\nThere is no community banking hub in Scilly, and residents can only go to the Post Office for simple tasks such as depositing money. Both Barclays and Lloyds sent representatives to the islands for a short period after closing their banks, but difficulty finding staff and making the journey meant both have since stopped.\nAvril Mumford, an 82-year-old resident, says: \u201cGoing to the Post Office is just not the same as going to the bank. I\u2019m not asking for a bank manager, but even if they just had a representative here to help people. Even if it was just once a month, it would be something.\u201d\nBut while simple tasks such as checking your bank balance have become easier by the advent of mobile banking, often when islanders need to visit their bank, it is because they have no other option. Scilly has a disproportionately high number of small business owners and unlike personal banking, tasks often need to be carried out in-person.\nFrances Grottick, who is vice-chairman of the Council, recently paid close to \u00a3200 to visit the mainland and visit her bank. \u201cI wanted to add somebody as a signatory onto an account\u2026you can\u2019t do that online, you have to attend in person which means going to Penzance or for some islanders as far as Truro which is obviously a considerable expense.\u201d\nJoe Babcock paid even more money \u2013 it cost him \u00a3240 in airfares to get to his local bank. \u201cThat\u2019s money you don\u2019t really need to spend,\u201d he says. Babcock, who owns Guiding Star, a passenger boat which ferries tourists between the different islands, recently had to travel to Penzance to change his business address.\n\u201cWe can go to the Post Office to deposit money, and some of our business has gone online anyway, but I had to go on a special trip to change my business address. You couldn\u2019t do that online in the same way that you could do with a personal bank,\u201d Babcock says.\nTim Guthrie spent weeks dealing with Lloyds over the phone in the summer of 2022 after receiving an unexpected letter saying that his two business accounts were to be shut down.\nHe manages almost 60 different holiday lets for owners and used his two accounts to hold the funds before they were paid out to owners after the guest had completed their stay. While his accounts were still eventually closed, he believes the issue could have been dealt with had the bank manager still been in place.\nHe has since had to set up 56 bank accounts, one for each property, to resolve the problem; otherwise, he says he would have had to close his business, making eight members of staff redundant.\nGuthrie, who has been banking with Lloyds for almost 50 years, says: \u201cEighteen months I\u2019ve been doing that. It\u2019s absolutely bonkers but the amount of work and the amount of grief, it\u2019s shortened my life by god knows how long, my blood pressure was through the ceiling.\u201d\n\u2018There is a big social implication to this\u2019\nGuthrie\u2019s anger is that despite no longer being able to see his local branch manager or having any local representative from the bank who understands his business, he is still paying Lloyds the same amount for his business accounts.\nCouncil chairman Robert Francis, who owns the Star Castle Hotel, in St Mary\u2019s agrees with Guthrie.\n\u201cI know people call it progress but it\u2019s not progress really. It might suit the banks to operate in this kind of way, but it certainly does not suit the end consumer.\u201d\nBoth banks appear in rude health, Barclays had a pre-tax profit of \u00a36.6bn last year, while Lloyds stood at \u00a37.5bn. The most recent figures for the Isles of Scilly show the GDP was just \u00a363m in 2021.\nFrancis says: \u201cIf you are running a business over here like we are, we are obviously taking a lot more money in our main season and the winter costs us a lot of money but you can\u2019t pick and choose. It seems to me Lloyds is picking and choosing.\n\u201cAt the end of the day they\u2019ve got to say this is where we make our money, however in order to run a bank that is actually going to work for its customers and not just work for commercial purposes, we have to take a hit with these other expenses.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got an ageing population here as well. Some of them are pretty savvy [with online banking], some of them don\u2019t want to go anywhere near it and yet they still need financial guidance and help.\n\u201cThey need to understand their retirement and have discussions about their money and what they can do. If you can\u2019t get on the internet and you can\u2019t get any local support, it\u2019s very difficult for them and their mental health to sort it out.\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got to have family or other people who can do it for them and not everybody has that. Some people are living alone, some people just don\u2019t have the support. There is a big social implication to this.\u201d\nThe population of Scilly fell by 6.8pc between 2021 and 2011, according to census data, despite the South West as a region increasing by 7.8pc. Between the two censuses, the average age of islanders increased by four years from 46 to 50, and more than a quarter of the population are now retired.\nAfter almost 40 years running Scilly\u2019s oldest newsagents, Mumford is about to join them and take her well-earned retirement.\nLast month, her husband Clive died. Rather than visiting her local Lloyds branch, a bank she joined at the age of four, she was left having to speak to call centres to help close her husband\u2019s accounts.\n\u201cNormally you could pop into the bank and do it there but I had to do it by telephone and you have to wait quite a long time before you get through. In the past, you could have gone into the bank and had it explained to you because I didn\u2019t know what the procedure was.\u201d\nShe adds: \u201cI can do banking online but there are some elderly people who can\u2019t, they wouldn\u2019t know where to start. I run a corner shop and people like to have a chat, they like to talk to somebody, they don\u2019t really want to do it all online.\u201d\n\u2018It hit home how vulnerable we are\u2019\nBack in the Council chambers, vice-chairman Grottick recalls how Lloyds broke the news to the local politicians it was closing Scilly\u2019s last remaining bank in 2022.\n\u201cThey set up a Microsoft Teams meeting when they realised they were going to take away our last bank.\n\u201cWe sat there and four people with very long titles sat around a table and one of them was the \u2018customer facilitation relationship manager\u2019 and she said \u2018What can we do to help?\u2019, I replied: \u2018Don\u2019t close the bank.\u2019\n\u201cThe conversation got a bit stilted because it seemed only at that point did they realise what they were doing to a small isolated community.\u201d\nFamed for its pristine beaches and turquoise waters loved by thousands of holidaymakers each summer, the locals are crying out for help to make sure Scilly remains a viable place to live all year round.\nGrottick says: \u201cWe aren\u2019t looking for handouts, we want to look after ourselves, but we need help and something like the loss of our last bank [hit] home just how vulnerable we are and just how much support we need.\u201d\nFrancis says: \u201cI may be short-sighted but I don\u2019t think so, I\u2019ve been in business all my life. I know from my hotel business how much value there is in word of mouth and goodwill. Nearly all our guests return and they tell everyone else, and that is the backbone of our business \u2013 and it can\u2019t be much different with a bank.\u201d\nHe adds: \u201cIf there was serious goodwill generated by a bank, they would actually benefit from that far more than they are possibly imagining.\u201d\nA spokesman for Lloyds Bank said: \u201cWe made the decision to close our St Mary\u2019s branch in 2022 as customers were choosing to bank in different ways and using the branch less often. The local Post Office on Hugh Street offers everyday banking, customers can also manage their money online, through our mobile app or by calling us.\u201d\nA Barclays spokesman said: \u201cAs visits to branches continue to fall and customers increasingly bank online, we need to adapt to provide the best service for all our customers. In 2018, the majority of our branch customers in the Isles of Scilly used alternative methods to bank, which led to a decline in branch use prior to closure.\n\u201cWhere levels of demand don\u2019t support a branch, customers can use our digital services be it online or via the Barclays app. We also support access to cash with our cashback without purchase service, 24-hour deposit-taking ATMs and by working alongside the Post Office and Cash Access UK.\u201d\nRecommended\n'We're the first county to lose every single bank'",

        "date": "Thu, 22 Feb 2024 10:14:00 GMT",
        "text": "Lloyds Banking Group has set aside \u00a3450m to cover potential compensation claims from the mis-selling of car finance, in a brewing scandal which has drawn comparisons with the PPI crisis.\nChief executive Charlie Nunn rejected the analogy, which has been made by figures including the consumer champion Martin Lewis, as he made the provision alongside Lloyds\u2019 annual results.\nMr Nunn said: \u201cWe think this is a very different situation.\u201d Lloyds had to pay almost \u00a320bn over the PPI scandal, which crippled the bank for many years.\u201d\nThe bank is one of Britain\u2019s biggest car finance providers through its Black Horse unit.\nMr Nunn stressed that motor finance was a \u201creally important\u201d financial service and the scale of motor finance loans made to customers was lower than those in the PPI redress scheme.\nHe also said customers also held loans for a shorter period.\n\u201cThe total amount per customer from a lending and exposure perspective is less so we don\u2019t think this is like prior remediations,\u201d he added.\n\u201cThere are a complex set of issues here and providing clarity to customers and the industry we think is really important.\u201d\nThe FCA is examining whether motor dealerships failed to inform customers about \u201cvariable\u201d commissions paid by banks to dealers in relation to the interest rate on the loan.\nThe watchdog will report its findings in September.\nLloyds also revealed it was facing an FCA investigation into possible money laundering at the bank. In a short statement, the bank said the probe focused on compliance with \u201cdomestic UK money laundering regulations\u201d.\nLloyds added: \u201cThe group has been fully cooperating with the investigation. It is not currently possible to estimate the potential financial impact, if any, to the group.\nA spokesman declined to comment further.\nLloyds Bank share price performance\nFrom 24 Feb '19 to 21 Feb 10:09:59\n20202021202220232024-60.0%-40.0%-20.0%0.0%20%\n \u2b24 Lloyds Banking Group PLC: 50.31 \u2192 43.10-14.3%\nThe FCA effectively banned the sale of variable commissions, which raised too many conflicts of interests to set high interest rates. Lloyds is the first bank to set aside cash for car finance compensation.\nClose Brothers, another motor finance lender, cut its dividend last week but said there was too much uncertainty.\nSantander has said there is too much certainty. Barclays also decided not to take a provision earlier this week due to the \u201clow levels\u201d of complaints it received and uncertainty. Natwest has no exposure.\nDespite the remediation costs, the bank rewarded shareholders with a new \u00a32bn buyback programme.\nA large write-back of bad debt from the repayment of overdue loans to the Barclay family helped the bank push forward with the buyback.\nLloyds seized control of The Telegraph last year by appointing receivers until the debt was repaid in full in December.\nMr Nunn said the write back was worth roughly \u00a3700m and was a \u201cgood outcome\u201d for shareholders.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a recovery of course of losses that we incurred over the previous years. All of our borrowers always have a legal right to pay down their loans and that\u2019s what we saw happened,\u201d he added.\nThe final dividend was 1.84p per share, giving a total payout for the year of 2.76p per share, up 15pc on last year.\nProfit after tax was \u00a35.5bn and net income was 3pc higher at \u00a317.9bn.\nLloyds is Britain\u2019s biggest bank with a network of 11,000 branches.",

        "date": "Thu, 30 Nov 2023 07:11:00 GMT",
        "text": "The price of crude oil fell after a cartel of oil-producing nations led by Saudi Arabia surprised the market by issuing a statement that failed to include an expected pledge to cut production by another million barrels per day.\nBrent crude, which is used to price the sale of two-thirds of the world\u2019s oil, had climbed by 5.1pc over the last three days to more than $84 (\u00a366) a barrel in the run up to Thursday\u2019s meeting of the Opec+ group of 23 oil-exporting countries.\nThe online gathering of producers aimed to prop up the declining price of oil and has ended with an agreement to cut output by at least another one million barrels per day by early next year.\nSaudi Arabia, the de facto leader of the group, has already been cutting supply by a million barrels a day since the summer and will extend the time period of these cuts as well.\nBut Brent Oil fell after the Opec+ meeting issued a statement that avoided a united commitment to cuts in production. The price is down 2.47pc on yesterday.\nOil prices had fallen 8pc this month before its recent rally amid concerns about global demand next year and as the Israel-Hamas war failed to impact supplies.\nThe meeting had originally been scheduled for Sunday but was delayed after disagreements from some of the alliance\u2019s smaller nations over their contributions to the cuts.\nThe Opec+ group pumps more than 40pc of the world\u2019s oil, meaning cuts to supply potentially have huge implications for petrol prices.\nIn related news, Opec+ announced that major oil producer Brazil will join the group from January. UBS analyst Giovanni Staunovo said: \u201cConsidering that Brazil is a large oil producer and is driving oil production growth it is important to have them on board, but it seems that they are not cutting production like Mexico.\u201d\nRead the latest updates below.",

        "text": "An investment fund backed by Abu Dhabi has confirmed plans to take ownership of The Telegraph \u201cat an early opportunity\u201d as MPs on the culture select committee urgently discuss the implications for press freedom.\nRedBird IMI, led by the former CNN chief Jeff Zucker and mostly funded by Abu Dhabi royalty, is in line to take control of The Telegraph within weeks as part of its efforts to build an international media empire.\nA spokesman said: \u201cAny transfer of ownership will of course be subject to regulatory review and we will continue to cooperate fully with the Government and the regulator.\u201d\nIt added that The Telegraph\u2019s operations will be solely managed by RedBird Capital, Abu Dhabi\u2019s US private equity partner in RedBird IMI, distancing editorial matters from the Gulf state.\nThe spokesman continued: \u201cInternational Media Investments [Abu Dhabi] will be a passive investor only.\u201d\n\u201cRedBird IMI are entirely committed to maintaining the existing editorial team of the Telegraph and Spectator publications, and believe that editorial independence for these titles is essential to protecting their reputation and credibility.\n\u201cWe are excited by the opportunity to support the titles\u2019 existing management to expand the reach of the titles in the UK, the US and other English-speaking countries.\u201d\nThe fund is also bidding in an \u00a31bn auction of Britain\u2019s biggest independent television producer, All3media, the maker of the BBC reality show The Traitors, The Telegraph can reveal. All3media declined to comment.\nRedBird IMI is seeking to gain ownership of The Telegraph as soon as mid-December by helping to finance a \u00a31.2bn debt repayment from the Barclay family to Lloyds Banking Group. The bank took control of The Telegraph and The Spectator magazine in June by sending in receivers following a protracted dispute over unpaid debts and interest.\nRedBird IMI will provide the family with a \u00a3600m loan tied to a 12-month option to convert the lending to shares. Abu Dhabi would provide funding to repay the balance of the debt directly to the Barclay family, secured against their other businesses including the online retailer Very.\nLloyds is currently assessing whether the repayment offer clears compliance hurdles in relation to anti-money laundering and so-called Know Your Client regulations. If no problems are found it is legally obliged to return The Telegraph and The Spectator to the Barclay family, regardless of their plans to effectively sell the assets on.\nRedBird IMI said it will call in its option on The Telegraph \u201cat an early opportunity\u201d, interpreted by insiders as almost immediately after Lloyds has assessed the offer and accepted payment.\nMPs on the Commons culture committee are expected to hold private talks over the planned transaction on Tuesday, amid calls for it to be investigated as a potential threat to free expression and even national security.\nDame Caroline Dinenage, Conservative chairman of the committee, said: \u201cThis is a complex and confusing situation - it\u2019s important that the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport scrutinises the financing and ownership of any deal closely.\u201d\nThe committee has powers to launch inquiries, call witnesses and seek answers from officials. The Culture Secretary, Lucy Frazer, has a crucial role to play in scrutiny, with powers to intervene to protect the public interest in free expression.\nShe recently told media executives: \u201cMy priority, and that of this Government, will always be standing right behind our media and protecting freedom of the press at every turn.\u201d\nThe prospect of a fund majority-backed by an autocratic Arab state owning an influential news publisher has sparked concern both outside and inside The Telegraph.\nMore than half a dozen Conservative MPs have already called for official investigations of the transaction, with Dame Caroline\u2019s comments the latest sign of anxiety. The Business Secretary Kemi Badenoch and security minister Tom Tugendhat, who both attend Cabinet, have privately voiced concerns.\nIn a note to newsroom staff on Monday Chris Evans, editor of The Telegraph, said: \u201cYou\u2019ve been asking me how we can be confident that editorial independence would be protected. At the moment I know no more than you will have read. For now, we must continue with our work.\u201d\nWhile Lloyds scrutinises the Barclay family offer for two weeks, a separate auction of The Telegraph managed by Goldman Sachs and an associated transfer of the business into a new and unencumbered company are continuing. Bidders including a consortium led by the hedge fund boss Sir Paul Marshall and the publisher of The Daily Mail, among others, have been urged to submit their first-round bids by 28 November.\nA spokesman for the Barclay family declined to comment.",

        "text": "The Abu Dhabi-backed investment fund RedBird IMI is in line to take control of The Telegraph within weeks in a deal that is causing concern among Conservative MPs.\nRedBird IMI would serve as a conduit for a \u00a31.2bn loan, mostly provided by the Emirati royal and Manchester City owner Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed Al Nahyan, which would allow the Barclay family to repay in full a debt to Lloyds Banking Group.\nIt is understood that almost as soon as that deal is completed, the loan would be converted to shares, making RedBird IMI owner of The Telegraph.\nLloyds seized control of The Telegraph in June by sending in receivers after losing patience with the Barclay family over long standing debts. The family made an offer to repay their owings in full with backing from RedBird IMI last week, threatening to derail an ongoing auction process that has attracted interest from the hedge fund chief Sir Paul Marshall and Daily Mail publisher DMGT, among others.\nOn Sunday, Lloyds was still assessing the Barclay family offer. However, sources indicated that it was likely to be satisfied that legitimate funds were in place to complete repayment.\nThat could mean RedBird IMI, which is led by the veteran American television news executive Jeff Zucker, would be in control of The Telegraph as soon as mid-December following a two-week due diligence process where Lloyds is being advised by Lazard.\nNevertheless, the rival investment bank Goldman Sachs is continuing to run the auction process, in which first-round bids are expected by the end of the month.\n Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed partly funds investment vehicle RedBird IMI Credit: UAE PRESIDENTIAL COURT/REUTERS\nThe perception that an influential news publisher would be under the effective control of a foreign power has alarmed some Conservative MPs. Calls for the potential transaction to be scrutinised have increased, with senior ministers under pressure to assess its impact both on the public interest in free expression and on national security.\nA letter signed by the senior Tories Sir Edward Leigh, Sir John Hayes and Baroness Margaret Eaton has urged the Deputy Prime Minister Oliver Dowden, the Business Secretary Kemi Badenoch and the Culture Secretary Lucy Frazer to intervene.\nThe MPs wrote: \u201cMaterial influence over a quality national newspaper being passed to a foreign ruler at any time should raise concerns, but given the current geopolitical context, such a deal must be investigated.\u201d\nThere was \u201ca strong case for close scrutiny by the government under both the Enterprise Act 2002 and the National Security & Investment Act 2021\u201d, they wrote, highlighting questions over the hefty price that RedBird IMI appeared willing to pay. Analysts have valued The Telegraph at about half the value of the loan the Abu-Dhabi-backed fund is preparing to make to the Barclay family.\nPotential bidders in the auction of The Telegraph were warned by Lloyds representatives that not more than 25pc cash from the Gulf would be allowed to fund any deal. It is understood that about four fifths of the Barclay family\u2019s \u00a31.2bn debt repayment would come from Abu Dhabi.\nThe National Security & Investment Act 2021 grants ministers sweeping powers to block takeovers and financing transactions that are judged to threaten national security.\nRedBird IMI has appointed lobbyists to argue its case, which is likely to emphasise the scale of existing Abu Dhabi investment in the UK. In late 2021 the Government claimed a \u00a310bn foreign direct investment coup in a deal with Mubadala, Abu Dhabi\u2019s sovereign wealth fund.\nSpokesmen for Lloyds, the Barclay family and RedBird IMI declined to comment.",

        "text": "The future of the humble paper bank statement is at stake amid a cash crunch at the main print supplier to Britain\u2019s big high street banks.\nA finance industry-led rescue operation to save Leeds-based Communisis is being spearheaded by Lloyds but hopes of a salvage deal were fading this weekend.\nIt is understood the advisory firm Interpath has been put on standby amid concerns that the company faces the growing threat of insolvency. An estimated 1,000 jobs are at risk.\nFears for the future of the business have been heightened after Lloyds took the unusual step of telling some customers they would be switched to online statements without explaining the reason for the move.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve moved your statements from post to paper-free,\u201d some customers were told in a letter earlier this month.\nLloyds said the changes would take place from the beginning of November. \u201cWe\u2019re experiencing some issues and may not be able to send as many by post as we normally do,\u201d the letter went on.\nLloyds, which currently owns The Telegraph but has no involvement in editorial matters, has already led one survival plan including a two-part \u201cInterim Funding Agreement\u201d, totalling \u00a313m, that other major banks took part in.\nRegulatory rules require banks to provide paper statements \u201cor in another durable medium\u201d if a customer requests one. Yet, demand for paper statements is falling sharply. The most recent accounts for Communisis, for 2021, detailed a 20pc decline in its core printing business due to the ongoing switch to digital communications.\nCommunisis was plunged into crisis when its American parent OSG Holdings declared bankruptcy after racking up large losses in recent years.\nIt was the second time in 14 months that the company had sought Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. The first occasion allowed it to trim $134m (\u00a3110m) of debts from a balance sheet weighed down total borrowings of $824m.\nIt posted losses of nearly \u00a325m in 2021 and \u00a339.8m the year before.\nCommunisis was approached for comment.

        "text": "Nigel Farage will start banking with Lloyds after the controversial closure of his Coutts account.\nThe former UK Independence Party leader said on Friday he was relieved to have been offered an account by Lloyds, Britain\u2019s biggest mortgage provider, after he was rejected by a string of other high street lenders because of his political views.\nIt comes after his accounts with Coutts were closed over the summer after staff decided his views did not \u201calign\u201d with the bank\u2019s own values \u201cas an inclusive organisation\u201d.\nWhen the row went public, it triggered a furore that led to the resignation of Dame Alison Rose as chief executive of NatWest, which owns Coutts.\nAn official inquiry into debanking was also launched.\nMr Farage, who is a presenter for television channel GB News, said his offer from Lloyds, which was first reported by Sky News, came after \u201cbig name\u201d high street lenders had turned him down in recent months.\nHe told the The Telegraph: \u201cLloyds Bank has offered me banking facilities and I have to say, having been rejected by 10 banks, it is just nice to know that there is a high street lender that doesn\u2019t suffer from political prejudice.\n\u201cI have spent countless hours on phone calls and in face-to-face meetings and there was a point where I really thought nobody would bank me at all \u2013 I tried everyone.\n\u201cSo I now understand what so many other people and businesses have been through in the last few years. It is astonishing.\u201d\nLloyds currently owns The Telegraph following a dispute with the Barclay family, who owned it for almost two decades. The bank has no involvement in editorial matters.\nA spokesman for Lloyds said: \u201cWe do not comment on customer relationships.\u201d\nThe Financial Conduct Authority last month published its interim findings in a review of debanking after Chancellor Jeremy Hunt demanded that the regulator look into the issue.\nBut to the dismay of Mr Farage, Conservative MPs and some Government ministers, the City watchdog said it found \u201cno evidence\u201d customers had been debanked for their political views.\nThis was despite the regulator\u2019s admission that it had not examined Mr Farage\u2019s case at Coutts.\nIt also did not seek evidence from those who actually claim to have been debanked, relying only on submissions from banks themselves.\nMr Farage added: \u201cI am sorry, but I could give you a dozen members of the House of Lords, right now \u2013 or their family members \u2013 who have had banking problems, and the same goes for MPs.\n\u201cThe FCA review has been a complete farce.\u201d\nNikhil Rathi, the FCA\u2019s chief executive, has previously defended the report, stressing that the watchdog is committed to conducting further work on the issue.",

        "text": "Ministers should intervene to protect press freedom and prevent \u00a31.2bn in loans to the Barclay family turning into an Abu Dhabi takeover of The Telegraph, lawyers for the hedge fund chief Sir Paul Marshall have said.\nIn a letter to a consortium led by Sir Paul, which had been bidding for ownership in a competitive auction, legal advisers White & Case said there were grounds for the Culture Secretary, Lucy Frazer, to prevent the Gulf-backed deal being completed within weeks.\nMs Frazer is minded to issue a Public Interest Intervention Notice (PIIN) and could do so as soon as this week, Sky News reported last night.\nA PIIN triggers investigations by Ofcom and potentially the Competition and Markets Authority.\nWhite & Case argued that Ms Frazer would be justified in also issuing a \u201chold-separate\u201d order to prevent RedBird IMI, an Abu-Dhabi-backed investment fund converting its loan to the Barclay family debt into ownership of The Telegraph.\nThe memo, seen by The Telegraph, said: \u201cWe consider it reasonable and justified for the Secretary of State to issue a PIIN immediately\u2026 [and] to impose an order that at the very least prevents RedBird IMI from exercising its option to acquire ownership and/or control over The Telegraph and The Spectator.\n\u201cThis is especially justifiable given the opacity by which the Barclays and RedBird IMI have sought to explain the arrangements.\u201d\nLloyds Banking Group has halted the auction of The Telegraph after RedBird IMI agreed to help fund full repayment of the Barclay family\u2019s \u00a31.2bn debt with new loans.\nThe bank said the competitive process run by Goldman Sachs would be suspended until 4 December while it scrutinises the family\u2019s offer to repay its borrowing. A parallel auction of The Spectator magazine has also been stopped.\nSources said Lloyds had been left with little choice but to pause the auctions after its dealings with the Barclay family angered bidders. As well as Sir Paul\u2019s consortium they included the Daily Mail publisher DMGT and National World, a local newspaper group.\nThere is mounting concern in Westminster over the prospect of an undemocratic foreign state gaining majority control of an influential news publisher.\nThe Prime Minister\u2019s official spokesman insisted that press freedom was \u201cvitally important\u201d at a Downing Street briefing with journalists.\nHe said: \u201cIt\u2019s a crucial part of democracy that the Prime Minister has talked about previously, and will continue to support.\u201d\nRishi Sunak is scheduled to visit the United Arab Emirates (UAE) in early December for the COP28 climate conference. Next week representatives of the Arab absolute monarchy are expected in London at the Government\u2019s Global Investment Summit.\nFollowing a private meeting today, the Commons culture committee vowed to look at \u201cforeign state ownership\u201d of media and other British cultural assets and commissioned officials to work up options for further inquiry.\nDame Caroline Dinenage, Conservative chairman of the committee, told The Telegraph: \u201cThe potential foreign state ownership of a British newspaper title raises important concerns.\n\u201cWhile it is not for the committee to review the details of this case, we will want to consider the wider implications about foreign state ownership of media, culture and sport institutions and will return to the issue shortly.\u201d\nLloyds seized control of Telegraph and The Spectator in June by sending in receivers, after losing patience with the Barclays years after repayment had been due. In the following months the family made a series of offers to cover part of what they owed, until last week when they made an offer for the full amount. If the offer clears regulatory hurdles Lloyds would be obliged to end the receivership and return the titles into Barclay family ownership.\nHowever, the deal would be funded by two complicated loans, one of which would be provided by the investment fund RedBird IMI and would immediately convert to ownership of The Telegraph.\nRedBird IMI is a joint venture between the US private equity firm RedBird Capital and International Media Investments (IMI), a venture backed by Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed Al Nahyan, vice-president of the UAE and owner of Manchester City. Abu Dhabi cash would account for most of the \u00a3600m price.\nIMI would directly loan the balance of debt to Lloyds to the Barclay family, and take security over their other business interests. They include the online retailer Very, formerly known as Littlewoods.\nDavid Davis, the senior Conservative MP and former Brexit Secretary, said: \u201cThere are clear public-interest concerns with an investment in a major UK newspaper, like The Telegraph, by a company reportedly owned by the vice-president of the UAE.\n\u201cIt is clear the regulatory authorities need to look very carefully into this before considering any approval.\u201d\nRedBird IMI, led from New York by the former CNN chief Jeff Zucker, has said that transfer of ownership would be subject to regulatory review with which it would fully cooperate.\nIt said: \u201cRedBird IMI are entirely committed to maintaining the existing editorial team of the Telegraph and Spectator publications and believe that editorial independence for these titles is essential to protecting their reputation and credibility.\u201d\nLloyds bank is scrutinising the Barclay family\u2019s repayment offer under anti-money-laundering and so-called Know Your Client regulations before a British Virgin Islands court hearing early next month.",

This includes digital and paper-based import and export documentary letters of credit, documentary collections, undertakings and trade loans.\nCleareye.ai\u2019s ClearTrade technology will be implemented from this month\nThe AI-powered technology will also conduct automated examinations of documents, in line with the International Chamber of Commerce Rules for Documentary Credits and Collections, as well as critical compliance checks, including trade-based money laundering checks.\nRogier van Lammeren, head of trade and working capital products at Lloyds Bank Commercial Banking, said: \u201cWe\u2019re continually looking for ways to help our clients trade simpler, faster and more efficiently and our partnership with Cleareye.ai enables us to deliver this.

        "text": "Citigroup has downgraded Lloyds Banking Group PLC due to ongoing concerns related to the UK\u2019s motor finance review. Citigroup lowered Lloyds\u2019 rating from \u201cbuy\u201d to \u201cneutral\u201d while maintaining an \u201coverweight\u201d rating for the UK banking sector overall.\nDespite Lloyds announcing a \u00a33.32 billion profit for the first half of the year, which exceeded market expectations, Citigroup highlighted that the bank fell short on pre-provision profit. Lloyds was unique among its peers in missing this benchmark, attributed to \u201chigher operating lease depreciation\u201d and motor finance redress, which is anticipated to remain a challenge until May 2025.\nThe Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) recently delayed its review of the motor finance market from September this year to May 2025, causing further uncertainty. This review scrutinises the historic use of discretionary commission arrangements in the sector. The FCA said that redress payments related to discretionary commission arrangements (DCA) are now \u201cmore likely,\u201d adding to Lloyds\u2019s concerns.\nCitigroup maintained \u201cbuy\u201d ratings for HSBC PLC, NatWest Group PLC (LSE), and Barclays PLC, while Standard Chartered PLC (LSE) retained its \u201cneutral\u201d rating.\nExplainer: What is Discretionary Commission and why has the FCA launched a probe?\nInvestec sets aside \u00a330m amid FCA commission probe",
