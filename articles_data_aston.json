        "text": "Aston Martin tapped Bentley\u2019s chief executive officer, Adrian Hallmark, to take over as CEO and stabilize the luxury-car maker synonymous with James Bond.\nHallmark will replace 77-year-old Amedeo Felisa no later than October 1, Aston Martin said Friday. He\u2019ll be the fourth CEO to lead the company since billionaire Lawrence Stroll became executive chairman in 2020.\nHallmark, 61, led Volkswagen AG\u2019s Bentley for the past six years, bolstering its margins by leaning into personalized vehicles and instituting greater discipline on pricing and inventory. Aston Martin\u2019s transformation is one of the most exciting projects in the luxury-car industry, said Hallmark, who previously held senior roles at Porsche and Jaguar Land Rover.\nAston Martin has repeatedly needed to raise more capital since Stroll rescued the company four years ago. Saudi Arabia\u2019s Public Investment Fund, China\u2019s Zhejiang Geely Holding Group Co. and EV maker Lucid Group Inc. have taken stakes in the UK company since mid-2022.\nThe CEO announcement comes after Aston Martin earlier this month completed a \u00a31.15 billion ($1.4 billion) refinancing to ease investor concerns about its balance sheet.\nDuring his time in charge of Bentley, Hallmark helped to turn the ultra-luxury British brand around by cutting costs, hiking prices and focusing on personalized vehicles. He joins Aston Martin after Bentley\u2019s second-best year in its history.\n\u201cOn just a few thousand more cars than we used to sell in the 2000s, we\u2019re now making three times, four times the profit per year,\u201d he told reporters this month.\nHallmark also postponed the launch of Bentley\u2019s first fully electric vehicle to late 2026, rather than next year. That mirrors a move made by Aston Martin, which has pushed back its first battery model by a year amid a lack of demand.",

        "text": "Aston Martin sales went into reverse in the first six months of 2024 but the luxury carmaker reportedly said it expected recovery in the second half as it completed an update of its model line.\nThe Guardian reported the number of cars sold to dealers fell by a third to 2,000, while first half losses rose 52% to GBP216.7m.\nThe famed sportscar maker nearly went bust for an eighth time in 2020 but was saved by Lawrence Stroll, the billionaire fashion mogul, the paper noted.\nSince then, Stroll has struggled to turn the company around, first by trying to restore an air of exclusivity to the brand by reducing the number of cars held by dealers and sponsoring a Formula One race team, and then by releasing new models.\nIt launched a new Vantage sports car and the DBX 707, an update of the sports utility vehicle that has played a significant role in increased sales.\nSee Also:\nEaton collaborates with Tesla over home energy storage\nBorgWarner gets grant for motor control method using complex vector flux regulation\nAlongside DB12 and Vanquish sports car models, it the carmaker has a new lineup, with updated infotainment systems that addressed some criticism of previous models.\nAccording to the Guardian, Stroll said the launch of the sports cars and the SUV was a \u201cpivotal moment\u201d for the company after years of trying to turn it around.\nThe former Bentley boss Adrian Hallmark would take over as chief executive under Stroll, who is chair, in September.\nStroll said Aston Martin would start generating cash later this year, as the benefits of heavy investment finally bore fruit. \u201cWe have a big third and fourth quarter coming up,\u201d he added.\nThe Guardian added Aston Martin would still have big investments ahead, most notably in the shift to electric cars. None of the models it had made so far were electric, although it planned to release a plug-in hybrid version Valhalla super car in 2026, a year later than initially planned.\nAston Martin chief financial officer, Doug Lafferty, told the Guardian the company hoped to benefit from allowances for smaller manufacturers to continue to sell combustion engine cars up to 2035, five years after the Labour government\u2019s proposed 2030 deadline.\nHe said: \u201cThe current legislation allows for a derogation for small volume manufacturers and we don\u2019t see any deviation from that.\u201d",

        "author": "Matt Oliver",
        "date": "Wed, 24 Jul 2024 12:14:00 GMT",
        "text": "Aston Martin will tentatively enter the electric vehicle (EV) market next year with its first plug-in supercar.\nThe Valhalla will have a hybrid, three-motor powertrain capable of going from nought to 60 miles per hour in just 2.5 seconds and a top speed of 217 mph.\nYet the launch of the Valhalla, named after the mythological hall for slain Viking warriors, also underlines a question that still sits at the heart of Aston\u2019s electrification strategy: do its customers really want to drive an electric car?\nUnder plans previously set out by executives, the company would have launched its first fully-electric model in 2025.\nBut that has since been pushed back, with executives now saying it will now be launched in 2026 \u201cat the earliest\u201d.\nLawrence Stroll, Aston\u2019s billionaire executive chairman, has warned previously that demand for electric cars so far has been underwhelming.\nHe is also sceptical that electric cars currently have the same allure for petrolheads, who love the \u201csmell, feel and noise\u201d of vehicles powered by roaring internal combustion engines.\n Lawrence Stroll, executive chairman of Aston Martin, has been sceptical about consumers' demand for EVs Credit: Darren Staples/Bloomberg\nThis is an issue faced by sports car and supercar makers across the board, says Nick Parker, automotive partner at consultancy AlixPartners.\n\u201cIn a high-performance sports car, customers are often looking for exhilaration and a thrill and, in reality, many still see that as being something you only get with the sound of a combustion engine behind them,\u201d he says.\nOn the racetrack, EVs still do not match petrol cars either.\nWhile they can deliver extremely fast acceleration, they are unable to sustain peak performance for more than a few laps without running out of juice or overheating, says Parker.\n\u201cWhen you are talking about going from a standing start, it\u2019s fine. But in terms of sustained racing performance, EVs remain a long way off,\u201d he adds.\nFor Aston, a carmaker associated with the glamour of James Bond, this makes shifting to EVs potentially risky, despite the tightening of regulations across Europe.\nOther carmakers face similar issues, with different brands hedging their bets in different ways.\nFerrari, for example, is seeking to replicate the celebrated roar of its engines artificially for the electric era, so drivers still hear the sound when they press down on the accelerator.\nBut some are focusing on the development of so-called e-fuels \u2013 synthetic chemicals made from carbon dioxide and hydrogen that are billed as \u201csustainable\u201d alternatives to petrol.\nFormula 1, which the Aston Martin brand competes in, has championed these fuels, with cars in the series already using \u201cE10\u201d fuel \u2013 a blend of 90pc petrol and 10pc ethanol made from biomass \u2013 and plans in motion to switch to 100pc e-fuels by 2026.\nSticking with hybrids\nMeanwhile, German sports car maker Porsche is also pioneering production of these synthetic fuels at a pilot factory in Chile.\nThis partly explains, says Parker, why brands such as Aston want to stick with hybrids as long as possible.\nIt was also why some such as Porsche lobbied so hard and successfully for a carve-out from EU rules on reducing vehicle emissions to zero by 2035. Under a loophole demanded by Germany, cars powered by e-fuels will be exempt.\nE-fuels are marketed as sustainable because they can be made from carbon dioxide drawn from the atmosphere, thereby meaning anything emitted from the tailpipe is not technically a net addition.\nWhat\u2019s more, although these fuels are expected to be expensive, particularly as they will require costly \u201cgreen\u201d hydrogen input, that is not likely to be much of a problem for the likes of Aston\u2019s well-heeled customers.\n\u201cA lot of the luxury brands will actually continue with hybrids for longer on the basis of the opening that was left in the EU regulation,\u201d Parker adds.\n\u201cThe technology is moving forward quite quickly and for luxury sports car manufacturers it offers an opportunity for an alternative to simply switching from combustion engine cars to pure electric.\u201d\nThere are also some other advantages to hybrids such as the Valhalla, which can run quietly on their electric motors at first before switching to their powerful petrol motors at speed.\n\u201cYou can start off on electric in your street so you don\u2019t wake up your neighbours, before getting to the open road,\u201d Parker says.\nWhether Aston and others will be able to pursue this strategy in the UK remains a mystery, however.\nThe new Labour Government pledged to bring forward a ban on sales of new petrol cars to 2030, in an effort to speed up Britain\u2019s switch to electric models.\nSmaller-volume producers such as Aston will be exempt at first but only until 2035. There is then uncertainty about whether cars powered by e-fuels will be allowed after that point.\nFor now, Aston is staying coy about when exactly it will launch its first battery electric vehicle (BEV).\nBut the company insists a technology partnership with American BEV brand Lucid means it is in pole position to get going whenever the time is right.\nAlongside this, the company is planning to spend \u00a32bn over the next five years on product development. A sizable chunk of the cash will go towards electrification but also to hybrids and the company\u2019s last combustion engine cars.\n\u201cGoing forward, the focus will shift on to electrification,\u201d Doug Lafferty, Aston\u2019s finance chief, said on a call with journalists.\n\u201cBut we\u2019ve taken a blended powertrain approach, which means that we\u2019ll continue to look at bringing internal combustion engines, PHEV and BEV to the market as we move forward.\u201d\nFor now drivers can carry on getting their thrill from an old-fashioned petrol motor. What is under the hood in a decade\u2019s time, however, may be a different story.",

        "text": "A Canary Wharf office once occupied by a casualty of the 2008 banking crisis is to be sold at a \u00a3160m discount in the latest blow to London\u2019s beleaguered financial district.\nAn Israeli real estate investor has bought 5 Churchill Place in a \u00a3110m deal, seven years after it was acquired by Cheung Kei Group, a Chinese investor, for \u00a3270m.\n5 Churchill Place, which was occupied by American investment bank Bear Stearns before its demise during the financial crisis, was placed in receivership last year after Cheung Kei Group defaulted on loans backed by the property.\nAriomori has now bought the lease at a 60pc discount in a deal brokered by Savills, React News reported.\nThis sale marks one of the largest distressed sales in London so far. The Chinese investor had previously tried to offload 5 Churchill Place in 2022 for around \u00a3400m but was unsuccessful. The building is primarily let to JPMorgan on a long-term lease.\nThe Chinese company bought 5 Churchill Place with \u00a3196m of debt, approximately 70pc of the building\u2019s worth, with around \u00a3175m provided by Lloyds Banking Group.\nIt comes as Britain\u2019s offices have faced a severe reckoning as stubbornly high interest rates sent values tumbling.\nMeanwhile, the rise in hybrid working has piled additional pressure on office owners as it has led to many businesses downsizing their workspace.\nThe sale of 5 Churchill Place is yet not confirmed but it is likely to set a precedent for the value of properties in the already beleaguered financial district.\nCanary Wharf has suffered a number of high-profile exits, with HSBC\u2019s decision to leave its global headquarters last July in favour of the City dealing the district its largest blow.\nOther companies including Clifford Chance and Credit Suisse have also announced that they will leave the district.\nEmpty office space in the Docklands now stands at 16pc \u2013 the highest level in years.\n5 Churchill Place is one of three buildings for sale in Canary Wharf. The property formerly home to the Financial Conduct Authority has been put on the market by Blackstone, having been bought in 2014 for around \u00a3165m.\nCheung Kei Group has a second building in the district, 20 Canada Square, that receivers will also likely be looking to sell later this year. The company has already defaulted on its \u00a3265.5m loan against the building.\nMatthew Pointon, senior property economist at Capital Economics said: \u201cAs businesses look to downsize, many will take the opportunity to move to central, prime areas in a bid to attract staff into the office. We therefore think Canary Wharf will continue to underperform.\u201d\nCanary Wharf Group, which owns swathes of land across the district, secured a \u00a3400m cash injection from shareholders last year.\nThat included cash from private equity group Brookfield and the Qatar Investment Authority.\nIn May last year, rating agency Moody\u2019s said the company would have difficulty selling its offices without \u201coffering substantial discounts\u201d.\nCheung Kei Group has been contacted for comment. Savills declined to comment.\nRead the latest updates below.",

        "author": "Matt Oliver",
        "date": "Thu, 11 Apr 2024 07:50:00 GMT",
        "text": "The boss of Aston Martin has branded a net zero ban on petrol cars \u201cpremature\u201d as global demand founders for electric vehicles (EVs).\nLawrence Stroll, the Canadian billionaire owner of the luxury British marque, claimed the push towards EVs was currently supported more by \u201chype\u201d than real consumer demand.\nMany buyers are simply not interested in buying battery-powered cars despite government incentives, he said, with a lack of charging infrastructure partly to blame.\nHis comments came as new figures showed record numbers of rapid EV chargers were deployed in the UK last month, but carmakers including Volkswagen and Mercedes warned of an electric car sales slowdown in Europe.\nSpeaking to journalists at Aston Martin\u2019s headquarters in Gaydon, Warwickshire, Mr Stroll said: \u201cWe\u2019ve just felt a real lack of consumer demand\u2026 and we\u2019ve seen and listened and read and heard what all the other big [carmakers] are going through in terms of pulling back \u2013 that it\u2019s just not happening at this pace and time.\n\u201cDo I ultimately think we all get there? Yes. Do I think it\u2019s going to happen as initially planned? Most definitely not.\u201d\nHe added: \u201cObviously, [legislation] was premature. We don\u2019t have the charging abilities put in place to deliver the initial time expectations, nor the demand.\n\u201cSo you know, politically, you cannot drive consumer demand. Let me put it like that.\n\u201cConsumer demand will be what consumer demand is, and that does not necessarily \u2013 as proven in this \u2013 follow legislation.\u201d\nAsked whether he expected Aston Martin to ever completely stop producing petrol cars, providing there was demand for them in some countries, he said: \u201cAs long as we\u2019re allowed legally to keep making them, we will keep making them.\u201d\nMr Stroll\u2019s comments come just months after the UK government brought into force the so-called zero emissions vehicle mandate, which forces manufacturers to sell increasingly higher proportions of EVs.\nAt least 22pc of their cars sold must be electric this year, with the target ratcheting up annually to reach 80pc by 2030. A total ban on new petrol car sales will then follow in 2035.\n Aston Martin boss Lawrence Stroll says demand for electric cars will not necessarily follow legislation Credit: Darren Staples/Bloomberg\nAs a smaller manufacturer, Aston is not bound by the sales targets but will be forced to comply with the 2035 ban.\nBigger carmakers who fail to reach the required level of EV sales will face fines or be required to buy and trade carbon credits.\nIt comes after Mr Stroll earlier this year delayed the launch of Aston Martin\u2019s first pure EV from 2025 to at least 2027 due to a lack of demand.\nInstead, the company is developing hybrid versions of a number of its models, including sports cars and its SUV, and use these as a \u201cbridge\u201d to electrification.\nSeparately on Wednesday, Anthony Browne, minister for decarbonisation of transport, pointed to new rollout figures for EV charging infrastructure as proof that coverage was improving.\nDriving organisations including the RAC have warned that \u201crange anxiety\u201d \u2013 along with high prices \u2013 continues to be one of the biggest put-offs for many would-be EV buyers.\nFigures published by ZapMap showed that 2,687 public chargers were deployed in March, the largest ever monthly increase. That took the total to 59,670 charging devices \u2013 49pc more than last April.\nMr Browne said: There\u2019s never been a better time to make the switch.\u201d",

We\u2019ll be back on the blog tomorrow, but there among the stories elsewhere on The Telegraph site, here are four key business ones:\nAsda\u2019s private equity backer snaps up stake in UK pet shop\nSunak pledges to retain triple lock for millions of pensioners\nBBC to write headlines using artificial intelligence\nPolestar secures \u00a3750m lifeline after Volvo pulls backing\n5:56PM\nEuropean central banker points to June for potential interest rate cut\nIn a glimpse of what Europe\u2019s central bankers are thinking, Gediminas Simkus, a European Central Bank governing council member, has told Econostream Media:\nAs I see it, June is really the month to consider the rate cut.\n5:02PM\nExtinction Rebellion activist detained during protest against insurers\nExtinction Rebellion activists have been protesting in the City of London for a third day today, demanding that companies stop insuring fossil fuel projects. Here, police officers detain a protester who set off a smoke flare.\n4:57PM\nFootsie closes down\nThe FTSE 100 closed down 0.76pc today.

He said the internet giant would \u201cenhance operational efficiencies\u201d during 2024.\nIn the final quarter, revenues were up 6pc to $4.92bn, while profits fell to $366m.\nFor the whole of 2023, revenues rose 9pc to $18.96bn, while profits rose 169pc to $2.86bn.\n4:34PM\nFormer chancellor takes new directorship\nLord Hammond, the former chancellor, is to become chairman of Railsr, the fintech business best known for buying the UK arm of Wirecard.\nSky News said that Lord Hammond will replace Rick Haythornthwaite, who is taking over as chairman of NatWest Group in April.\nIn a statement released to Sky News, Lord Hammond said he was joining Railsr at a \u201cpivotal moment in its development\u201d.\nThe peer chairs Copper Technologies, is a senior adviser to OakNorth Bank and is a partner at investment firm Buckthorn.\n4:13PM\nFrance calls for global minimum tax on the super-rich\nFrance wants a new push for a global minimum tax on the super-rich. During a visit to a G20 meeting in Sao Paulo, today, its finance minister Bruno Le Maire said:\nCurrently the richest people can avoid paying the same level of tax as other people who are less rich. We want to avoid such tax optimisation ...\nWe want Europe to take this idea of minimum taxation of individuals forward as quickly as possible, and France will be at the forefront.\nHe said it only made sense to crack down on tax optimisation by the super-wealthy at the international level in line with what has been achieved with a global minimum corporate tax.\nMore than 140 countries have so far backed a 2021 agreement to apply a corporate income tax of at least 15pc from this year to discourage multinational groups from shopping around for countries with the best tax rates.\n4:03PM\nIndia warns over World Trade Organisation \u2018standstill\u2019\nA US-led push to reform the World Trade Organisation\u2019s embattled dispute settlement system sparked divisions at a WTO meeting in Abu Dhabi today, with India accusing Washington of bringing the trade body to a \u201cstandstill\u201d.\nThe Trump presidency brought the system to a grinding halt in 2019 by blocking the appointment of new judges to the WTO\u2019s appeals court.\nWashington has accused the appeals court of over-interpreting WTO rules, with US Trade Representative Katherine Tai today saying the now-defunct body was formerly more powerful than member states.\nIt was \u201cextremely activist, extremely powerful, more powerful than even the members, where members could secure new rules through litigation and not have to rely on the very hard work of negotiating with each other,\u201d she said.\nWashington\u2019s push for reform has angered India.\nIndia threatened to hold off on any new deals before progress is made on the appeals court, which could imperil agreements on fisheries subsidies and agriculture, largely seen as the main agenda items of the current ministerial talks.\n3:59PM\nRegulators gives Boeing 90 days to deliver plan to raise standards\nAmerica\u2019s Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is giving Boeing 90 days to come up with a plan to fix quality problems and meet safety standards for building new planes.\nThe regulator said the directive follows meetings with top Boeing officials including the company\u2019s boss at the FAA\u2019s headquarters in Washington.\nMike Whitaker, the FAA Administrator, said:\nBoeing must commit to real and profound improvements. Making foundational change will require a sustained effort from Boeing\u2019s leadership, and we are going to hold them accountable every step of the way \u2026\nBoeing must take a fresh look at every aspect of their quality-control process and ensure that safety is the company\u2019s guiding principle.\nThe new deadline is being set as the FAA finishes an audit of assembly lines at the factory near Seattle, where Boeing builds planes including the 737 Max that suffered a door-panel blowout in January. Investigators say bolts that help keep the panel in place were missing after repair work on the Alaska Airlines jet at the Boeing factory.\nA Boeing spokesman said:\nBy virtue of our quality stand-downs, the FAA audit findings and the recent expert review panel report, we have a clear picture of what needs to be done. Transparency prevailed in all of these discussions. Boeing will develop the comprehensive action plan with measurable criteria that demonstrates the profound change that Administrator Whitaker and the FAA demand. Our Boeing leadership team is totally committed to meeting this challenge.\nShares in Boeing are up 2.66pc in trading today.\n3:39PM\nTaylor Wimpey down 4.5pc after plunge in profits\nThe FTSE 100 housebuilder Taylor Wimpey has continued to slide on the stock market today, with shares down around 4.5pc after saying it would build fewer homes this year and revealing disappointing results.\nAarin Chiekrie, an equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, explains:\nTaylor Wimpey\u2019s put in a relatively resilient showing given the difficult market conditions of 2023. Full-year operating profits came in at the top end of group guidance, but this still represents a roughly 50pc fall from the prior year\u2019s levels.\nA combination of real house price declines and lower mortgage rates have helped to ease some of the affordability pressures for buyers since the beginning of 2023, and these trends appear to have carried into the new year.\nAccording to Rightmove, the first six weeks of 2024 saw a 7pc increase in buyer enquiries year-on-year. A low activity base could set the scene for a better performance in 2024, with Taylor Wimpey\u2019s trading early in the new year also seeming to support this view.\n3:34PM\nDirect Line confirms it rejected takeover bid\nDirect Line has confirmed it received an initial bid from Belgian insurer Ageas as it became the latest British listed company to become the focus of a potential foreign takeover.\nIn a stock market announcement, the company said it \u201creceived a highly conditional, non-binding indicative proposal\u201d at 233p per share.\nIt added:\nThe board considered the proposal with its advisers and considered it to be uncertain, unattractive, and that it significantly undervalued Direct Line Group and its future prospects while also being highly opportunistic in nature.\nAccordingly, the Board unanimously rejected the proposal on January 29, 2024.\nIt advised shareholders to \u201cto take no action in relation to the possible offer\u201d.\nWith that, I will head off for the day and hand you over to the ever eager Alex Singleton, who is poised to furnish you with the latest updates into the evening.\nDirect Line Insurance Group PLC\nLast\n181.7\nChange\n+4.8\n+ / - %\n2.71%\nTime\n13 Sept\n01:0002:0003:0004:0005:0006:0007:0008:00177,0178,0179,0180,0181,0Previous close: 176.9\n1 week\n-2.62%\n1 mth\n5.06%\n3 mths\n-6.10%\nYTD\n3.14%\n1 year\n7.21%\n3:24PM\nBitcoin in \u2018FOMO kind of rally\u2019\nBitcoin\u2019s intense rally has put the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency on pace for its biggest monthly gain since December 2020, when the digital token jumped 50pc to around $9,600.\nBitcoin has more than tripled in value since the start of last year, climbing back from a 64pc plunge in 2022, in a remarkable comeback from a series of crypto-industry scandals and bankruptcies that had raised questions about the viability of digital assets.\nMany analysts believe the recent surge has also been driven by the fear of missing out, known as FOMO.\nZaheer Ebtikar, founder of crypto fund Split Capital, added:\nWe are starting to see a pretty clear FOMO kind of rally.\nMore and more people are just convinced to buy.\n3:11PM\nBitcoin \u2018halving\u2019 helps fuel rally\nAn upcoming reduction in bitcoin\u2019s supply growth, known as the halving, is adding to the optimism which has driven its price towards its record high.\nAfter the halving, expected in late April, the number of new coins mined daily will decline to 450 from 900 currently.\nIf this demand stays constant, with supply of new coins cut in half, advocates are predicting that the price has room to rally.\nDan Slavin, founder of Chainview Capital, a crypto hedge fund, said:\nAll of this combined makes for a supply and demand imbalance.\nMore demand than supply means price higher, and with BTC price volatility, price higher doesn\u2019t mean 10pc, it means a whole lot more.\nRyan Kim, head of derivatives at digital-asset prime brokerage FalconX, added: \u201cIt\u2019s pretty nuts.\u201d\n2:59PM\nWorld at risk of permanently higher taxes as borrowing hits $11.5 trillion\nCountries around the world are borrowing relentlessly at a scale far above pre-pandemic levels, credit ratings agency Standard and Poor\u2019s has warned, raising the risk of permanently higher taxes.\nOur deputy economics editor Tim Wallace has the details:\nWar, energy subsidies, welfare spending and high interest rates are all forcing governments to borrow more as they fail to bring their finances under control.\nEconomists fear it will force politicians to ramp up taxes across the globe as debt repayments increase in size and the desire for more spending grows.\nNations will borrow $11.5 trillion (\u00a39.1 trillion) in long-term debt this year, S&P forecast.\nThis graph shows how Britain\u2019s debt bill is surging and see below how global debt is growing.\n2:46PM\nBitcoin hits two-year high as Wall Street embraces crypto\nExchange-traded funds (ETFs) linked to bitcoin have theoretically enabled a wider public to invest in the cryptocurrency without having to hold it directly.\nThe funds themselves, however, do invest in the digital currency. Bitcoin ETFs were approved by US securities regulators on January 10, when the price was around $46,412.\nMikkel Morch of specialist fund ARK36 said US ETFs have \u201cinjected a fresh wave of optimism, propelling trading volumes and spotlighting crypto-linked firms\u201d.\nBitcoin, which last traded at about $60,123, is closing in on its all-time high of $68,991 hit in November 2021.\n2:34PM\nWall Street opens lower as US economy remains strong\nUS stock markets dropped at the opening bell as official figures showed the US economy grew 3.2pc at the end of last year, in a sign the Federal Reserve is unlikely to change its stance on interest rates any time soon.\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average has fallen 0.5pc to 38,754.79, while the benchmark S&P 500 fell 0.4pc to 5,060.17.\nThe tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite was down 0.6pc to 15,949.64.\nDow Jones Industrial Average\nLast\n41393.8\nChange\n+297.0\n+ / - %\n0.72%\nTime\n13 Sept\n07:0008:0009:0010:0011:0012:0013:004110041200413004140041500Previous close: 41096.8\n1 week\n1.57%\n1 mth\n5.18%\n3 mths\n6.93%\nYTD\n9.83%\n1 year\n19.48%\n2:13PM\nATP Tour signs \u2018multi-year\u2019 Saudi deal\nThe ATP Tour and Saudi Arabia\u2019s Public Investment Fund (PIF) have signed a multi-year strategic partnership, the governing body of men\u2019s tennis said, in a move highlighting the growing influence of the Gulf nation on global sport.\nThe PIF will now become the official naming partner of the men\u2019s rankings as well as partner ATP tournaments in Indian Wells, Miami, Madrid, Beijing, the season-ending ATP Finals in Turin and the Next Gen ATP Finals in Jeddah.\nIn a joint statement, the two bodies said the partnership marked \u201ca significant shared commitment to enhancing global tennis\u201d.\n2:01PM\nBitcoin tops $60,000 for first time in two years\nBitcoin has topped $60,000 for the first time in more than two years amid a flurry of excitement after the approval of wider trading methods in the US.\nThe world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency has surged by more than 42pc in February in what is the largest monthly gain since December 2020 during the pandemic-era boom.\nBitcoin was last up about 6pc today to $60,376 - its highest since November 2021, when it hit a record just below $70,000.\nIt comes as traders have poured money into the digital token following the approval of so-called spot exchange traded funds, known as ETFs.\nThe financial instruments allow investors to speculate on movements in the price of crypto without the risk of owning the asset.\nJoseph Edwards, head of research at Enigma Securities, said: \u201cEssentially, we\u2019re seeing the ETF effect ahead of schedule. Inflows into them stepped up quickly last week and have been sustained, and we think it\u2019s reflective of advisors getting out there very quickly to start selling the ETFs to clients.\u201d\nAntoni Trenchev, cofounder of Nexo crypto exchange, added: \u201cIf $60,000 doesn\u2019t whet the appetite, consider that 70pc of bitcoin supply has remained unmoved for a year, and the little that\u2019s left is being hoovered up by the likes of BlackRock and Fidelity, just as rewards for miners are about to be slashed in half. The stars are aligning for bitcoin.\u201d\nBitcoin\n1:47PM\nWall Street poised to slump as US economy stays strong\nUS stock indexes look poised to slump at the start of trading later after growth in the US economy was revised lower for the end of last year - but not enough to trigger a rethink in Federal Reserve policy on interest rates.\nMany investors are also keeping their power dry ahead of the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index on Thursday, the Fed\u2019s preferred inflation gauge, which is likely to show prices rose on a monthly basis in January.\nStocks have struggled in the days leading up to the report after a scorching rally in the previous week that was fuelled by upbeat earnings reports and euphoria around the potential for artificial intelligence.\nThe rally looks poised to hit the buffers, at least temporarily, after official figures showed US GDP grew by 3.2pc in the final quarter of 2023.\nIn premarket trading, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 0.2pc, the S&P 500 had dropped 0.3pc and the Nasdaq 100 had fallen 0.4pc.\n1:41PM\nUS economy grew 3.2pc at end of 2023\nThe US economy grew by a robust 3.2pc in the final three months of last year as it was buoyed by healthy consumer spending, official figures show.\nThe expansion in the nation\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP) \u2014 the economy\u2019s total output of goods and services \u2014 slipped from a red-hot 4.9pc between July and September, according to the Commerce Department.\nHowever it was a slight downgrade from initial estimates of 3.3pc.\nUS growth has now topped 2pc for six straight quarters, defying fears that high interest rates would tip the world\u2019s largest economy into a recession.\nFar from stumbling, the economy grew 2.5pc for all of 2023, topping the 1.9pc growth in 2022.\nUnited States GDP Growth Ratehttps://t.co/sUMfkn31hz pic.twitter.com/SwChWleNVk\n\u2014 TRADING ECONOMICS (@tEconomics) February 28, 2024\n1:29PM\nDirect Line becomes latest British company to face foreign takeover bid\nBelgian insurer Ageas has confirmed that it is considering making a \u00a33.1bn bid for Direct Line after losses hit its share price.\nAgeas said it was examining a possible offer 233p per Direct Line share, representing a premium of 42.8pc on its closing share price of 163.35p.\nShares in the British insurer have leapt 27.4pc following the announcement.\nLast year it agreed to sell its brokered commercial insurance business after revealing deepening losses.\nThe company, based in Bromley, south-east London, posted a pre-tax loss of \u00a376.3m in the first half of 2023, compared to \u00a3197m in profits recorded in the previous year.\n1:04PM\nFTX founder begs judge to reject calls for \u2018barbaric\u2019 100-year prison sentence\nSam Bankman-Fried is pleading with a US court to reject a recommended 100-year prison term, as lawyers for the disgraced crypto tycoon described the sentence as \u201cbarbaric\u201d.\nOur senior technology reporter Matthew Field has the latest:\nIn a court filing released on Tuesday, Mr Bankman-Fried\u2019s lawyers claimed the FTX founder should only serve up to six years for his role in the fraud.\nThis is in response to a recommendation from government officials who have called for Mr Bankman-Fried to spend 100 years behind bars.\nFTX filed for bankruptcy in late 2022 after a multibillion-dollar black hole was uncovered in its accounts.\nMr Bankman-Fried, 31, was accused of orchestrating a $10bn (\u00a37.9bn) fraud, siphoning off customer funds to fuel high-risk crypto trades and fund a luxury lifestyle in the Bahamas.\nRead why lawyers have urged judges to implement a more lenient sentence.\n12:28PM\nThousands of Welsh farmers protest after Brexit rule change\nThousands of farmers are expected to descend on Cardiff today for what could be one of the biggest farming protests the country has seen.\nNiamh Robinson and Emma Gatten have the details:\nUp to 10,000 farmers, vets and other agricultural workers are expected to protest around the Senedd as ministers meet for talks on changes to the Welsh farming system.\nFarmers are angry over proposals from the Welsh Labour Government to overhaul EU-era subsidies, which would see farmers expected to ensure 20 per cent of their farms are dedicated to tree planting and wildlife.\nOn Tuesday the Welsh Government said it would review the plans, which are currently under consultation.\nFollow our live blog on the protests.\n12:24PM\nCo-operative Bank profits slump as it compensates mortgage customers\nThe Co-operative Bank revealed its yearly profit nearly halved after it set aside cash to compensate mortgage customers from more than a decade ago.\nThe bank, which has about 2.6m customers and says it is the UK\u2019s leading ethical bank, said 2023 had been \u201ca year of transformation\u201d as it spent more money on improving its own systems.\nIt reported a pre-tax profit of \u00a371.4m, shrinking from the \u00a3132.6m it made in 2022, after it set aside nearly \u00a329m to cover the costs of a redress scheme to compensate mortgage customers from 2011 and 2012.\nIt followed complaints being upheld by the Financial Ombudsman Service relating to an increase in the rate of its standard variable mortgage rate, which most people move to once their fixed-term deal comes to an end.\nCo-op Bank said it had decided to compensate customers who might have been affected, regardless of whether or not they had complained.\nMeanwhile, chief executive Nick Slape said the bank continues to be in \u201cexclusive discussions\u201d with Coventry Building Society over a possible merger of the two high street lenders, which was first announced at the end of last year.\n12:01PM\nHalving inflation has broken biggest barrier to Scottish growth, says minister\nAs Scotland\u2019s GDP contracted at twice the pace of the UK, Scottish Secretary Alister Jack said:\nThe UK Government has halved inflation and, in doing so, we\u2019ve broken down the single biggest barrier to growth.\nWe are sticking to our plan to achieve long-term sustainable recovery.\nWe are boosting business and encouraging trade and opportunities by investing more than \u00a32.9bn directly across all parts of Scotland.\nWe\u2019re also putting more money in the pay packets of 2.4m people in Scotland by cutting national insurance and rewarding hard-working families with the biggest ever increase to the national living wage from next month.\n11:50AM\nDirect Line shares surge amid takeover speculation\nShares in Direct Line jumped after reports that it

services, retail trade and construction managers. Sentiment deteriorated most markedly in Italy, followed by Germany and Poland.\nAndrew Kenningham, chief Europe economist at Capital Economics, said:\nThe EC business and consumer survey for February reinforces the message that the economy is close to recession and that, although price pressures in the services sector eased slightly, they remain uncomfortably high.\nThe fall in the EC ESI from a downwardly-revised 96.1 in January to 95.4 in February left it below expectations.\nOn past form, this is consistent on past form with the economy continuing to stagnate in Q1.\nQuite a downbeat economic sentiment survey for the eurozone with the service sector indicating a worsening of demand and of expectations.\nThe upside comes from services inflation expectations which ticked down after 4 months of rises.

Lucid took a 3.7pc stake in Aston as part of the deal.\nThe delay comes after the boss of German car giant Mercedes-Benz has said it will make petrol cars \u201cwell into the 2030s\u201d as it watered down its targets for electric vehicle sales.\nMeanwhile, Sir Jim Ratcliffe last week accused British and European governments of forcing electric cars \u201cdown the consumer\u2019s throat\u201d, as he prepares to sell a new battery-powered 4x4 that will have a backup petrol engine.\nAston Martin revealed operating losses improved by 22pc to \u00a3111.2m last year, while revenues increased by 18pc to \u00a31.6bn as average selling prices hit record levels.\nIts billionaire chairman Lawrence Stroll, who is also the company\u2019s biggest shareholder, is hunting for his fourth chief executive in four years.\nAston Martin\u2019s shares seesawed in early trading but were last up 0.1pc.\n9:42AM\nSt James\u2019s Place to pay overcharging victims up to \u00a3426m as shares collapse\nSt James\u2019s Place has set aside \u00a3426m for customers who overpaid for advice and fees sparking a 31pc fall in the company\u2019s share price.\nOur money reporter Madeleine Ross has the details:\nThe wealth manager announced a major overhaul of its fees last year, following the introduction of new consumer duty rules by the financial watchdog.\nIt scrapped its exit fees and capped advice and fund charges, after an investigation by The Telegraph found that customers were paying thousands more for pension advice compared to St James\u2019s Place\u2019s rivals.\nIn its results for 2023, the wealth manager \u2013 which has more than 900,000 clients \u2013 wrote that it would provide \u00a3426m, or \u00a3323.7m post-tax, for \u201cpotential client refunds linked to the historic evidencing and delivery of ongoing servicing\u201d.\nChief executive Mark FitzPatrick said the firm\u2019s cash result had been significantly impacted by the assessment into advice and fees.\nRead how its latest results have wiped \u00a3392m off its valuation.\n9:34AM\nTaylor Wimpey expects to complete fewer homes amid planning delays\nTaylor Wimpey said it will build fewer homes this year, only days after Britain\u2019s competition watchdog concluded that the sector limited supply to maintain its prices.\nThe housebuilder said its first-half operating profit margin would reflect slightly lower pricing in the homes it has coming through, blaming cost inflation and investment.\nTaylor Wimpey joins other developers that have cut back their building targets as the Bank of England hiked borrowing costs to tame inflation, making houses more expensive.\nThe industry routinely complains that Britain\u2019s complex planning system is delaying the delivery of new homes.\nChief executive Jennie Daly said there were some signs of improvement as mortgage rates ease which was \u201cpositively impacting\u201d affordability, after reporting a 49pc slump in annual profit, in line with market expectations. She said:\nLooking ahead we are well-positioned in an attractive market, with significant underlying demand for our quality homes and are poised for growth from 2025, assuming supportive market conditions.\nThe company said it expects to build about 9,500-10,000 homes in Britain in 2024, excluding joint ventures, with the midpoint of the range about 7pc lower than last year\u2019s 10,438.\nTaylor Wimpey\u2019s shares fell 3.4pc in early trade.\n9:17AM\nGas prices edge higher after sharp falls\nGas prices are showing the first signs of recovery amid speculation that the low prices will stimulate demand.\nEurope\u2019s benchmark contract has risen for a third consecutive day after slumping 30pc since the start of the year.\nDutch front-month futures have gained as much as 3pc today to more than \u20ac25 per megawatt hour as temperatures are also forecast to be on the colder side in March.\nTraders think there could be a revival of demand in China and Asia as buyers capitalise on the fall in global gas prices.\nThe UK equivalent gas contract has risen as much as 2.3pc today to 62p per therm.\n8:51AM\nUK markets hit by string of poor results\nUK stock indexes have fallen as they were dragged down by a raft of dismal profits updates.\nThe FTSE 100 index slid 0.2pc and the mid-cap FTSE 250 dropped by 0.5pc.\nSt. James\u2019s Place slumped 29.3pc to the bottom of the UK\u2019s blue chip index after the wealth manager swung to an annual loss.\nI was hit by a \u00a3426m provision made for potential client refunds over historic ongoing servicing complaints.\nReckitt lost 9.8pc after the consumer goods group missed fourth-quarter like-for-like net sales estimates, while Taylor Wimpey slipped 2.6pc after the homebuilder said it would build fewer homes this year and posted a 49pc slump in annual operating profit.\nAston Martin was down 2.6pc after initially opening higher as investors remained at the luxury carmaker\u2019s continuing annual losses, which more than halved as selling prices hit record levels.\nBesides the corporate updates, investors are also awaiting the consumer prices data from the US and Europe due later this week for insights into the central banks\u2019 monetary policy path.\nSt James's Place PLC\n8:34AM\nDettol maker suffers \u00a355m hit after \u2018inappropriate\u2019 staff conduct in Middle East\nDettol and Durex maker Reckitt has plunged in early trading after revealing a \u00a355m hit after staff \u201cacted inappropriately\u201d in the Middle East.\nThe consumer goods giant\u2019s shares have fallen 9.7pc after it also revealed a drop in sales over the latest quarter, amid declines in its health and nutrition arms.\nThe company admitted making \u201can understatement of trade spend in two Middle Eastern markets\u201d which meant revenue performance was \u00a355m lower than previously expected.\nIt said: \u201cFollowing investigation, we concluded a small group of employees had acted inappropriately and we are taking necessary disciplinary action.\u201d\nThe household goods giant said like-for-like net revenues fell by 1.2pc over the final quarter of 2023, with overall net revenues down 7pc to \u00a33.6nn.\nIt added that like-for-like revenues for the full-year were up 3.5pc in 2023 against the previous year.\nKris Licht, chief executive of Reckitt, said:\nWhile our performance in Q4 was unsatisfactory, we look to 2024 and beyond with confidence.\nWe target another year of mid single-digit growth in health and hygiene, driven by a more balanced contribution from price, mix and volume.\n8:19AM\nHalfords plunges as shoppers put off motoring improvements\nHalfords has slashed its profits guidance for the current financial year as wet weather put shoppers off cycling and motoring improvements.\nThe retailer\u2019s share price plunged by 22pc as it said \u201cweak customer confidence and unusually mild and very wet weather\u201d were partly to blame, weighing on demand for both cycling and motoring products.\nThe retailer said that it expects to deliver pre-tax profits of between \u00a335m and \u00a340m for the year to March 29, having previously forecast between \u00a348m and \u00a353m.\nIt said it cut the guidance after weakness in its cycling, retail motoring and consumer tyres operations caused a \u201csignificant drop\u201d in retail revenues.\nHalfords said cycling and retail motoring were weak as lower confidence among customers and mild, wet weather affected footfall into stores but also reduced demand for some products, such as winter car accessories and car cleaning products.\nThe cycling market has also \u201cbecome more challenging and competitive\u201d amid consolidation in the sector, resulting in higher levels of promotions to drive sales.\n8:05AM\nUK markets subdued at the open\nStock markets in London were little changed as trading began after a Bank of England deputy governor reiterated that policymakers need to see more evidence about the persistence of inflation before they can cut interest rates.\nThe FTSE 100 was flat at 7,685.64 while the FTSE 250 was down 0.1pc to 19,142.19 after Sir Dave Ramsden said that there were still \u201celevated\u201d risks to inflation.\nFTSE 100\n7:59AM\nTaylor Wimpey warns of planning delays as profits plunge\nTaylor Wimpey has warned about the impact of planning delays as it revealed pre-tax profits nearly halved last year.\nThe developer said revenues dropped 20.5pc to \u00a33.5bn in 2023, while profits before tax dropped 47.8pc to \u00a3473.8m as buyers grappled with higher mortgage costs.\nIt completed 3,306 fewer homes last year, down 23pc to 10,848, as chief executive Jennie Daly said the \u201cplanning environment remains challenging\u201d.\nThe company highlighted \u201cdelays and resource pressures impacting housing land supply\u201d.\nIt comes as the competition watchdog found this week that planning systems across Britain were \u201cunpredictable\u201d, with many local authorities under-resourced and several without an up to date local plan for housing.\nTaylor Wimpey was also named as one of eight of Britain\u2019s biggest housebuilders that are under investigation for suspected illegal information sharing amid fears that collusion in the industry has pushed up prices.\nThe developer\u2019s shares had gained 24pc over the last six months amid hopes that the Bank of England was poised to begin cutting interest rates this year.\n7:47AM\nVodafone in talks to sell Italian business for \u00a36.8bn\nMobile phone giant Vodafone has confirmed talks to sell its Italian business to Switzerland\u2019s Swisscom in a deal worth \u20ac8bn (\u00a36.8bn).\nThe pair said they are in advanced exclusive discussions, with the proposed agreed price on a cash basis and including debts, although the full terms of the deal are yet to be finalised.\nVodafone said: \u201cVodafone has engaged extensively with several parties to explore market consolidation in Italy and believes this potential transaction delivers the best combination of value creation, upfront cash proceeds and transaction certainty for Vodafone shareholders.\u201d\nIt comes after FTSE 100-listed Vodafone rebuffed attempts by France\u2019s Iliad to merge the two companies\u2019 Italian businesses, which would have created the country\u2019s biggest mobile phone company.\nVodafone and Iliad had revealed the talks in December last year.\nThe sale to Swisscom tops the \u20ac6.6bn (\u00a35.6bn) it was set to have received as part of the Iliad tie-up.\nSwisscom said it plans to merge Vodafone Italia with its business in the country, called Fastweb.\n7:43AM\nAston Martin\u2019s losses shrink as it overcomes production delays\nAston Martin\u2019s losses shrank last year as it completed the first deliveries of its next generation DB12 sports car and overcame production delays.\nThe luxury car maker revealed operating losses improved by 22pc to \u00a3111.2m, while revenues increased by 18pc to \u00a31.6bn.\nIt comes as its billionaire chairman is hunting for his fourth chief executive in four years.\nLawrence Stroll, who is also the company\u2019s biggest shareholder, is said to have contacted current and former bosses of other luxury car manufacturers to ask whether they would be interested in taking the top job.\nMr Stroll said:\nCritical to the long-term success of Aston Martin is the strength of our iconic global brand and loyal, as well as evolving, customer base.\nContinued investment in both the brand and our go-to-market strategy are imperative to our success.\nAston Martin shares are down 93pc over the last five years and have fallen by 18pc since the

        "text": "Aston Martin has delayed the launch of its first electric car as the luxury marque\u2019s chairman admitted that drivers still want \u201cthe sports car smell, feel and noise\u201d of a petrol engine.\nThe luxury car maker had originally aimed to launch an electric four-wheel drive grand tourer as soon as next year but will now hold off until 2026.\nLawrence Stroll, Aston\u2019s executive chairman and biggest shareholder, blamed weak demand for higher-priced battery electric vehicles (BEVs) for the delay.\nThe Canadian billionaire said: \u201cAll our [BEV] technologies are in place\u2026 Everything is in place.\n\u201cThe only thing that isn\u2019t in place is the consumer demand at this early stage.\u201d\nMr Stroll added that drivers outside of cities still wanted the experience of driving a petrol-powered sports car.\nHe said: \u201cWhat we are feeling is there are people that still want some electrification to drive around the city for five, or 10, or 15 miles but still have the sports car smell and feel and noise when you get onto the auto routes.\u201d\nAston Martin will use hybrid cars, which use both battery and internal combustion motors, as a \u201cbridge\u201d to fully-electric models for now, Mr Stroll said.\nThe company has already launched its first plug-in hybrid supercar, the Valhalla, and has announced plans to launch plug-in versions of the Vantage, DB12, DBS and DBX models as well.\nMr Stroll is the latest car executive to express caution about the speed of the switch to EVs amid a slowdown in sales.\nGovernment rules mandate that 22pc of all new car sales this year must be fully electric, rising to 80pc by 2030. Manufacturers risk fines if they fail to hit the targets.\nHowever, consumers have baulked at high prices and a lack of charging infrastructure.\nSir Jim Ratcliffe, the billionaire behind Ineos who has developed his own four-wheel drive vehicles, last week warned BEVs are being \u201cforced down the consumer\u2019s throat\u201d.\nMercedes has also insisted it will keep making internal combustion engine cars \u201cwell into [the] next decade\u201d amid slow consumer uptake.\nAston Martin\u2019s decision to delay the launch of its electric sports car came as Stellantis, the car giant behind Vauxhall, Peugeot and Citroen, separately urged the UK Government to give more backing to BEVs.\nUwe Hochgeschurtz, the company\u2019s boss of European operations, told the Financial Times: \u201cThere must be clear advice: If you buy a BEV, it\u2019s good.\u201d\nSpeaking on Wednesday as Aston unveiled its latest financial results, Mr Stroll told journalists that the decision to delay the marque\u2019s first BEV was based on market demand not being \u201cwhat we thought it was going to be two years ago\u201d.\nHe added: \u201cAs far as the BEV is concerned, we believe consumer demand was just not at the pace of all the analysts and the politicians.\n\u201cWe do believe it will be there in the future \u2013 it\u2019s not going away. We just think there\u2019s a slight delay to the project.\n\u201cThat\u2019s why we think the hybrid is going to have a very long life, particularly for a company like us. It\u2019s about delivering thrills and excitement in the driving experience.\u201d\n\u201cSo before we get to the BEVs, we will have a portfolio of PHEVs [plug-in hybrid electric vehicles] and a continuation, of course, of our combustion engine.\u201d\nMr Stroll\u2019s emphasis on the experience of driving a petrol-fuelled car versus a battery vehicle highlights the concerns among sports car makers about whether quiet electric engines will hold the same appeal with motorists.\nFerrari has patented a method of reproducing the sound of its high-performance petrol and diesel engines as its electric models are revved up.\nMr Stroll\u2019s comments came as Aston said it had halved its annual losses to \u00a3240m, beating market expectations. It came as sales rose from \u00a31.4bn to \u00a31.6bn in 2023 and selling prices reached record highs on the back of demand for expensive models such as the Valkyrie.\nHowever, shares in the company still dipped 2pc in early trading as investors fretted over rising debt levels. The company is seeking to refinance its borrowings, which totalled \u00a3814m, this year.\nAsked whether Aston Martin still expected to meet a target of \u00a32bn in sales and \u00a3500m of adjusted profits by this year, executives said they would \u201csubstantially achieve\u201d the goals.\nSeparate figures published by the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders showed that UK car production rose by 21pc in January.\nA total of 82,997 cars were produced as supply chain problems that hit factories last year eased.",
